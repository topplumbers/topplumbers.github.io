<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber Columbus GA</h3>
<p>These guys were fantastic! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem on and off for several years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I picked this company because they had great evaluations and a reasonable cost, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a fantastic task tidying up after it as well.</p>
