<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
