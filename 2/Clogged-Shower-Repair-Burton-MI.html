<p>A total repipe of a home's water supply, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most intricate and pricey plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on entire home repiping. Current Review: Carlos and Lopez were remarkable. My 90 year old Dad's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos got to 8am the next day to repair. Since of the age of the home and location of the pipe, it was a difficult job. They worked for nearly 12 hours into darkness to ensure the system was working prior to they left. I am truly grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>
