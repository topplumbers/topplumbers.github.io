<p>Deluge systems are designed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems generally are installed in locations where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as aircraft garages. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then permits water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
