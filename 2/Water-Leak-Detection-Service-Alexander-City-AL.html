Check for leaks under the sink to confirm that your plumber's putty is making a great seal. Get rid of the drain stopper, and allow the drain and P-trap to fill with water. Look for leaks and tighten as necessary. Plug unit into a GFCI-protected receptacle, and organize cables as desired.</p>
<p>Strainers are advised prior to each backflow prevention assembly on non-fire battling water lines.
