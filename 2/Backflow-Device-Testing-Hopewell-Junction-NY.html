<p>When the safe and clean supply piping is linked to a system or component which goes beyond the operating pressure of the supply piping, backpressure might happen. Higher pressure can be caused by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or elevated piping in locations such as high-rise buildings or tanks. Drinkable and non-potable water or liquids can be forced into the drinkable supply system if these connections are not appropriately secured.</p>
<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you believe a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, attempt this: squirt a few drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After thirty minutes, examine to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has actually altered color. You most likely have a leak if it has.</p>
<p>The Plumbing Bureau's main focus is on safety within a building. Plumbing inspections ensure that water supply in buildings are connected appropriately, without any cross-connection to pollute drinkable water supply. Fixtures should be correctly caught, to prevent sewer gas from leaving into a buildings. Warm water heaters are also checked to ensure that they have been installed effectively, to prevent an explosion.</p>
