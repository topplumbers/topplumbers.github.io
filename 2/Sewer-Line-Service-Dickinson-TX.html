<p>No, you must NOT pour caustic chemical drain cleaners down your drains if you're major about protecting your drain and plumbing system. The reason is that these chemical cleaners can be much more destructive than valuable, potentially eating away at your pipes. Repiping is the replacement of either a single pipe or a house's entire plumbing system, consisting of both supply of water and drain lines. Usually, a whole-house repipe deserves the financial investment in the long run because it may address the root cause of the chronic plumbing problems in your house.</p>
<p>If you think your toilet has a leak, the bright side is that it does not necessarily require a repair of your whole system. A toilet's tank is made up of multiple small moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be replaced or repaired due to their regular usage. When these parts break, they result in small leakages that are tough to see with the naked eye. This is why it is important to call a plumber as quickly as you believe you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not only does a leaking toilet drainage, it can also cause flooding and water damage.</p>
<p>Even for a non-steel plumbing system, age will eventually take its toll. If you see that your plumbing suffers from various blockages, leaks, and water pressure change that no amount of repairs appears to stem, you need to seek advice from a reliable plumber about whole-house repiping as a solution. House owners should examine water pressure entering into their home on a routine basis.
