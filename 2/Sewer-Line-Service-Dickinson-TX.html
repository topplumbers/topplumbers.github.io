<p>No, you must NOT pour caustic chemical drain cleaners down your drains if you're major about protecting your drain and plumbing system. The reason is that these chemical cleaners can be much more destructive than valuable, potentially eating away at your pipes. Repiping is the replacement of either a single pipe or a house's entire plumbing system, consisting of both supply of water and drain lines.

A toilet's tank is made up of multiple small moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be replaced or repaired due to their regular usage. When these parts break, they result in small leakages that are tough to see with the naked eye. This is why it is important to call a plumber as quickly as you believe you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not only does a leaking toilet drainage, it can also cause flooding and water damage.</p>

House owners should examine water pressure entering into their home on a routine basis.
