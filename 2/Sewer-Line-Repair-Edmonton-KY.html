<p>Since 1980, backflow preventers have actually been legally mandated for specific structures by the New york city Sanitary Code and the Guidelines of the City of New York. The guideline was not strictly enforced till a push in recent years by the DEP's Cross-Connection Control Program, an effort that includes regular random inspections of New york city City buildings to make certain they remain in compliance.</p>
