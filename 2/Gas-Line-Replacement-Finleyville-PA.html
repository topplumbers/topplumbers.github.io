<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Tired of False Promises? Water circulates in the tank where small resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads function as a sponge, adsorbing the hardness minerals from your water. This process is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a process called regrowth). During this process, the resin beads are washed with the extremely concentrated saltwater option (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The brine forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and changed with sodium or potassium ions.</p>
