<p>Some makers declare that the electrical gadgets they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Considering that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one benefit declared for the user is the elimination of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant growth promotion have been declared, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just modify the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have.

A licensed professional can help you determine if your structure requires a backflow preventer or multiple devices, or if you qualify for an exemption. Exemptions, which are approved in incredibly rare cases where the building is deemed to not pose a danger to the water system, need to be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, however the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, as well as a preliminary test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
