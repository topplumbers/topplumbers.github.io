Water conditioners are devices that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to inhibit the scale from developing by reducing the effects of the firmness itself. Due to the truth that water conditioners use a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are in some cases thought about a greener option in areas where it is forbidden to use salt. Water conditioners do not effectively remove solidity from the water supply, nevertheless, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
