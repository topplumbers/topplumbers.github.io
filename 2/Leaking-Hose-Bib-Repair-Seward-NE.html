<h3>Sewer and Drain Cleaning Tips in Seward NE 68434</h3>
<p>Backflow means the undesirable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from occurring. Points at which a safe and clean water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be carefully developed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
