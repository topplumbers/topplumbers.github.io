<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both.
