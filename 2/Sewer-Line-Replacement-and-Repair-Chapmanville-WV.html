<p>Whether a supply of water is labelled "soft" or "hard" is dependent on the presence of 2 highly soluble minerals, calcium and magnesium. From a health viewpoint, these minerals have no adverse impacts and are, in truth, vital day-to-day nutrients. It is minerals that give water the revitalizing taste many people find desirable. However, when calcium and magnesium penetrate water, they buildup on contact surfaces, possibly plug pipes and damage water heaters, and reduce the efficiency of detergents and soaps. At this point the water is said to be difficult.</p>
