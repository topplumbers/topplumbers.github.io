<p>As a locally-owned business, stability and duty are incredibly crucial to building a credibility for excellence. Area 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of isolation backflow preventers (BFP) and Area 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses security of the safe and clean supply of water within a building these gadgets are called isolation" BFP. Again, the very best type of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to ensure there is an air gap, if there is no chance to offer one, then we inspect to see that the appropriate BFP device is set up. These BFP's, if testable, are needed to be tested (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months afterwards.</p>
