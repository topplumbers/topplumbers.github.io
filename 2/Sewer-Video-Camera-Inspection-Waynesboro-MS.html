If the element is not fixed correctly, the guide could restrict the movement (rather than stable or direct) of the component, which might trigger the part to not work to its abilities. Lot of times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are limiting the travel of the component triggering lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>
