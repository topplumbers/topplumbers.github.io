If, state, you need a new burner package and the hot water heater is 5 years of ages, then it makes good sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, specifically if you can do the work yourself. The closer the home appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more skeptical the economics of a repair ends up being. The factor is that some other part on the device will go or its tank will leak. And there's no cure for a leaking tank.</p>
