It has two spring checks, however also has a 3rd check valve that is really a vent available to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk circumstances is due to the fact that if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains.
