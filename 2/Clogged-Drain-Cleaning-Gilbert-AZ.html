<p>Changing the old disposal with a similar new one is less complex than replacing with a different model. So, if you are not looking specifically for a various disposal this might be something to consider. An entirely various disposal, or for installing your very first disposal, the sink adapter needs to be puttied into location. A safe and secure seal is a must. Once linked at the sink drain, the dishwasher connector is connected. The last thing is to wire up the brand-new disposal, making sure to link wires properly, and the base covered to protect the electrical wiring from any water getting in.</p>
