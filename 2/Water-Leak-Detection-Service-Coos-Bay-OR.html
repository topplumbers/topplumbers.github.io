<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed issue. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>It is common for water heaters to leak due to varying pressure, and the temperature level and pressure relief valve is part of the system for that exact reason. However while little drips need to not be trigger for concern, property owners need to watch on the water heater leakages. When we required a leak in a pipe fixed, I had a terrific experience with Gotelli Plumbing. Tom was professional and friendly. He also did the job faster than original approximated, so the work was cheaper than I anticipated. I will utilize Gotelli Plumbing once again in the future.</p>
