<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a couple of things you can do to keep your drains clear. Avoid putting grease or oil down the drains. Utilize an option of baking soda and vinegar periodically to keep your drains and waste disposal unit clean. You can use a natural drain cleaner regular monthly to keep your drains clear.
