<p>It is not constantly due to clogs that come from inside the home when drains are clogged. It is possible for drains to end up being clogged due to tree roots, also referred to as tree root invasion. When tree roots begin to make their way inside someone's main sewer line, there is potential for this to trigger drain problems. The kind of drain pipes currently set up, such as cast iron, plastic, copper or clay, will figure out the degree of the damage that tree roots can cause to a sewer line.</p>
<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undiscovered problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
