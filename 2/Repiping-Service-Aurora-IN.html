<p>Agilent's series of leak detection solutions ensure the safety, security and constant performance of research, vacuum, and commercial process systems. Examining the water meter is an excellent next step in your plumbing inspection. If the water meter is turning, close all faucets and check. If it is, there is a leak someplace and this could be major problem. Proceed to the valves. Start with the main turned off valve operation. When turned off, no faucet in your house should have water. This opts for every other turned off valve and their matching faucets. If whatever is working appropriately, you are off to a great start.</p>
