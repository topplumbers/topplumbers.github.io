<p>An unusual gurgling noise when your bathtub drains or your toilet flushes is never a good indication. Do not depend upon a plunger to remedy the concern-- depend on your plumber for sewer line repair.

Many fire sprinkler heads, other than sprinkler heads on a deluge system are kept closed by a heat-sensitive operating system. Generally, this operating mechanism is either a fusible link or a glass bulb.  No matter the operating system, only the sprinklers that are exposed to heat will open during a fire.</p>

However, if they remain in one location for long, as they may in a hot water heater, the accumulation might still take place.</p>
