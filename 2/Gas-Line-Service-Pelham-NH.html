<p>House owners can ask for a plumbing inspection at any time, but it is specifically sensible to arrange inspections on an annual basis and when acquiring a new house. Enzyme-Based Drain Cleaners: Like the baking soda and vinegar mix, an enzyme treatment will likewise keep pipes running smoothly. Enzymes are bacteria that feed on raw material, such as hair, mold, algae and other typical clog-causers. This all-natural option is efficient and safe. Contact us today at High 5 Plumbing to purchase our recommended enzyme cleaner, Bioclean.</p>
<p>Your storm drains do not go straight into the ground and into oblivion either, this water is usually channelled elsewhere to a close-by treatment plant, a creek, or perhaps the ocean in.
