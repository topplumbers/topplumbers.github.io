<p>The cost to replace galvanized pipes is from $2,000 to $15,000 depending upon if you utilize PEX, copper, or another material. Due to the fact that of the method galvanized pipes tend to degrade over the years, changing galvanized pipes in older houses is crucial. Galvanized pipe is made by finishing steel pipe with zinc. As time moves on, the zinc erodes, exposing the steel.</p>
