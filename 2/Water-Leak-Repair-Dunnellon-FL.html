<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey said that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are rather popular with homeowners in the area. He kept in mind that there are specific pollutants that homeowners are handling and an RO can help ease those issues. Due to being mostly farming in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some property owners are installing ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are an item of farming waste. Rinckey noted that these systems get rid of around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic also naturally takes place in some soils which too can be fixed with the right RO system.</p>
<p>Improvement plumbers typically charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Once again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. But more and more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend a lot more. With this approach, you know the turnkey price entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
