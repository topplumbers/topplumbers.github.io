<h3>Residential Plumbing Services Rockton IL</h3>
<p>The most efficient way to attend to hard water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When difficult water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Water softeners normally have a lifespan of 15 years, nevertheless, water softener systems can last much longer if they are appropriately preserved. Making sure the brine tank never runs out of salt will extend the unit's life.  Protecting the resin bed from high levels of iron and manganese will also safeguard the system. Iron will foul the resin and lower its ion exchange efficiency. Resin cleaners enhance the regeneration cycle and aid alleviate the resin beads of hardness-causing minerals.</p>
