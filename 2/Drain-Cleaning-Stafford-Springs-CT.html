<h3>Sewer and Drain Cleaning Tips in Stafford Springs CT 06076</h3>

Pipe Repair to correct your toilet problems. It will be much less expensive to work with the best team now rather than neglecting the problem and enabling comprehensive damage to your plumbing system.</p>
<p>A. Typically wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered problem. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
