<p>The types of backflow preventers the company provides consist of double check valve assemblies, double check detector assemblies (including stainless-steel models), and minimized pressure zone assemblies. Suggestion: If the disposal has a line to the dishwasher, get rid of the plastic drain plug (or "knockout") from the disposal inlet prior to mounting the disposal. Also connect the dishwasher discharge tube to the inlet when you attach the P-trap.</p>
<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high threat" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, however also has a 3rd check valve that is actually a vent open up to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk circumstances is due to the fact that if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve uses an extra layer of defense compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the factor that when you check an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
