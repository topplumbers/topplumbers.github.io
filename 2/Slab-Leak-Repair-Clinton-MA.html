Sediment Build-Up: If you observe unusual popping, banging, or clanging noises coming from your unit, this could be a sign that sediment has built up in your tank, and is triggering a reaction with the heating element. Lacking warm water quickly is another sign of sediment accumulation, due to the fact that the sediment is taking up more area in the tank, so your water for that reason takes longer to heat. To fix this issue, you will likely need to eliminate the tank.</p>
