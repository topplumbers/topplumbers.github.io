<p>Keep in mind that repiping a home is a major plumbing repair, and you must only employ a trusted and well-respected contractor like Cabrillo in order to ensure that the job is done right. The average cost to install a drip leg is $75 to $150, which is a plumber's minimum charge. For several installs, costs vary from $33 to $89 per drip leg. Leak legs record moisture so that it doesn't get in the control system. Although little pieces of sediment may survive a drip leg.</p>
<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a worn flapper is usually the culprit. But not constantly. Initially, look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's excessive slack in the chain, it can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing firmly. A chain with insufficient slack can cause problem too. Picture 3 shows how to set the slack perfect.</p>
