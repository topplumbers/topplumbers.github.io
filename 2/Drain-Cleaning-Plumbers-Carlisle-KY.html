<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Tired of False Guarantees? Water flows in the tank where small resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads act as a sponge, adsorbing the solidity minerals from your water. This process is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have actually maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a procedure called regrowth). During this process, the resin beads are washed with the extremely concentrated saltwater solution (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The salt water requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and replaced with salt or potassium ions.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
