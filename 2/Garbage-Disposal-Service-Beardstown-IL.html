<p>An overall repipe of a home's water supply, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most costly and complex plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in entire home repiping. Recent Review: Carlos and Lopez were fantastic. My 90 year old Dad's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos got to 8am the next day to repair. It was a hard task since of the age of your home and location of the pipe. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to make sure the system was working before they left. I am truly grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>
