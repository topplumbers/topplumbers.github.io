You may smell the disgusting odor of sewage before you feel the squish of your lawn under your feet (ideally shoed feet!).

Plumbers describe a sewer line break as a plumbing emergency. Ideally, your Evanston plumber's phone number is on your speed dial.</p>

Difficult water causes these problems due to the minerals in the water that are left behind after a wash.
