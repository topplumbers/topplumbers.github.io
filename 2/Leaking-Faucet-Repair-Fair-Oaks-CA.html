<p>The most reliable method to address hard water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When difficult water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Plumbing is a vital part of your home or business, and its capability to function is necessary. If you experience regular problems with your plumbing, like drains clogging, this might be a sign of a larger issue, like a tree root intrusion or a large clog. If the drains clog periodically however you can typically flush them out, this might be a smaller clog like an accumulation of grease from the kitchen, or hair and soap scum from the bathroom.
