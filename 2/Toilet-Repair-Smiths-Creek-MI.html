The average cost of an aluminum garbage disposal varies from $60 to $150, while a stainless steel waste disposal unit has a typical cost of just over $150. Sewer pipes can be notoriously hard to trace, specifically on older residential or commercial properties, so you'll want to employ somebody who will trace the problem at its origin.</p>
<p>For instance, a plumber on an online forum sponsored by tool manufacturer Ridgid reports charging $125 for a camera inspection done as part of cleaning out a sewer line with a cable television and cutting blade (called snaking) or $225 if done separately. And video inspection rates at Allied Drain Cleaning 1 in Connecticut begin at $175, while Covenant Pipeline 2 in California charges a minimum of $275 for as much as 2 hours and $175 per hour for each extra hour.</p>
