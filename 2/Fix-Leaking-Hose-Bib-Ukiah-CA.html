<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and a great guy. He told me exactly what to anticipate (cost, time, process) in advance and provided as promised. I will definitely use Clog Dawg once again. Installing a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical hourly rate of $25 to $70. These rates are in addition to the cost of the disposal system. The total you pay may be greater if your plumber has a minimum callout fee that is higher than the labor cost for the work.</p>
<p>Renovation plumbers generally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Once again, this does not include the cost of parts. However increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest far more. With this technique, you know the turnkey price entering into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
<p>The EcoWater ESS1152 Series are non-resin based systems that can be customized to your water needs. Your EcoWater Pro will evaluate your water to identify the best water treatment for your home.

The CareSoft ® system was developed with the very same advanced engineering as the Pro and Elite models, with resin that provides high-performance hardness elimination you can count on for many years to come.</p>
