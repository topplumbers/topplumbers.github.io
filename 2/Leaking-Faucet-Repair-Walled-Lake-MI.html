Just put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. You can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that does not work. Many of these cleaners contain concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very harmful if it comes in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs.
