<p>One typical method for a home's water system to be polluted is if the watering water lines, which might become polluted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines. The problem might spread greatly if that contaminated water were to backflow into the community drinking supply. A backflow preventer not just secures drinking water in individual houses, it likewise prevents wastewater in private houses from flowing back out and infecting the public supply of water.</p>
<p>Often, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces information on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to know what the field test data suggests for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
