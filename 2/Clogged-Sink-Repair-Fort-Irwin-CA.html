The beads act as a sponge, adsorbing the solidity minerals from your water. This process is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a process called regeneration). Throughout this procedure, the resin beads are washed with the extremely focused saltwater solution (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The brine requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and changed with sodium or potassium ions.</p>
