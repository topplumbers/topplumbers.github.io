<h2>Tips To Hire Certified Plumbing Service in Byron</h2>

<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the homes in our area were constructed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for hot and cold water became standard. Older houses were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that is available in contact with water and oxygen will wear away. This deterioration, or rust, causes the iron to swell up and end up being flaky. In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and develops a waterproof membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>
