<p>Changing your sink is a detailed procedure. Procedure, cut, and connect the pipes. Prior to connecting any pipes to your water softener, step and cut your pipes to fit. Solder on any nipples and fittings prior to linking the unit to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic if you are utilizing copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can likewise be utilized. Though it may need extra adapters, flexible tubing is far simpler to deal with and can use push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the hassle of soldering.</p>
