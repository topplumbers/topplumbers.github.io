<h3>How Often Should Plumbing Check Lincoln AL</h3>
<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic rust Direct contact between dissimilar metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever two different types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is developed since of the procedure. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not completely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to alleviate this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
