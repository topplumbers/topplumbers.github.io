<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service DFW Plumbing Service Nashua NH</h3>
<p>The most efficient way to address difficult water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When hard water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Water softeners typically have a life-span of 15 years, nevertheless, water softener systems can last much longer if they are appropriately preserved. Making sure the brine tank never runs out of salt will extend the unit's life.  Safeguarding the resin bed from high levels of iron and manganese will also secure the system. Iron will foul the resin and lower its ion exchange performance. Resin cleaners improve the regeneration cycle and help ease the resin beads of hardness-causing minerals.</p>
