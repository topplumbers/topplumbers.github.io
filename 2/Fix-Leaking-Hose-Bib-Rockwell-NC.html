Area 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of isolation backflow preventers (BFP) and Section 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses protection of the potable supply of water within a building these gadgets are known as seclusion" BFP. Once again, the very best type of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to ensure there is an air space, if there is no way to provide one, then we examine to see that the proper BFP device is installed.

Most of toilets are standard sized - implying a "will fit" seat suffices for safety and comfort.
