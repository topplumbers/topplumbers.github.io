<p>In the meantime, however, we suggest you first try using non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Just put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. You can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that doesn't work. A lot of these cleaners consist of concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be extremely damaging if it comes in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If using one of these products, please make sure to take the suitable preventative measures.</p>
