<p>The U-shaped pipe below kitchen and bathroom sinks is something that individuals expect to see but rarely stop to think of. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you turn the switch, however it does not grind up food, this means the flywheel is stuck.

At the same time, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
