<p>Kitchen sinks are constantly susceptible to obstructions with food and grease being the significant perpetrators. They harden to the piping walls if fats are put down the sink. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, attaching to the walls also. Even tree roots can create serious drain obstructions by twisting around pipes. Their squashing strength stops the water circulation, requiring plumbers to find and repair the problem for regular house plumbing operations. You need your drain cleaned before it leads to more damage and even more expensive repairs if this is what is taking place to your house.</p>
