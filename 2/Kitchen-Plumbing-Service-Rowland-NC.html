Thankfully, Mr. Rooter ® Plumbing is your local source for quality sewer repair and replacement at any time.</p>
<p>Any time the pressure on the home (downstream) side exceeds the pressure on the city side, the two redundant check valves close-- avoiding any backflow. However, while DCV systems are thought about safe for a lot of fire security systems, they do have a defect: if both valves fail or debris in the water line prevents them from closing completely, backflow can occur.</p>
