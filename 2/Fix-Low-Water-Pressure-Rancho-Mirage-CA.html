<p>Home water softeners, likewise called ion exchange systems, are devices that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium.

After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride option ends up being a waste stream that goes down the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
