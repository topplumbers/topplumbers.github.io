<p>The individual who does the testing must be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not required to acquire this accreditation. I have actually consulted a few plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, however I would anticipate the cost to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>

<p>A leaking toilet can lose water and trigger water damage, and a running toilet wastes up to 7,500 gallons of water each year, causing water costs to increase.

<p>The very best source for this kind of plumber is a general contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's concealed; you don't get that opportunity. In addition, your contractor knows the dead giveaways of quality work that you may miss, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, properly sized holes in floors, joists, and studs. Lastly, a quality contractor will not danger working with a substandard plumber. A basic mistake-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can easily ravage $10,000 worth of walls or hardwood floors and complicate the job with insurance coverage claims, lost time, and claims. With a lot riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick with just the very best.</p>
<p>Your provider will call when the installer is on the method, normally about an hour before the arranged consultation time. Upon arrival, a relied on professional will present their Home Depot Service Provider badge, and perform the initial walkthrough to confirm the scope of work. Once you consent to move on, the installation can begin. This usually just takes a couple of hours, however if there are unpredicted situations, your provider might need to return the following day.</p>
