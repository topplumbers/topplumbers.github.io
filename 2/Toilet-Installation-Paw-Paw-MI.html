<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code secures the public water system and personal on-site water system and distribution systems by restricting cross-connections between drinkable (suitable for drinking) and non-potable water systems, and by needing installation of secondary and main backflow prevention methods. Secondary backflow approaches supply an increased level of protection for the general public water supply system.</p>
<p>Supplied there isn't a tank failure, usually a commercial hot water heater can be fixed, but is it worth fixing? Only after addressing the following concerns must you respond to repair or replace.
