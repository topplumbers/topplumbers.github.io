<p>The program achieves its mission by offering the adoption and promulgation of suitable guidelines and guidelines for the building and construction of plumbing centers where mandated. Cold showers? High energy costs? It might be time for a brand-new hot water heater. But in order to profit of a new energy-efficient device, you'll need to have it set up properly.

That's why installation is best left to professional plumbers who understand the ins and outs of your plumbing system.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not needed to get this accreditation. I've consulted a few plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, however I would expect the rate to be considerably less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
