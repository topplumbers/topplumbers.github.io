<p>Galvanized steel safe and clean water supply and distribution pipes are typically found with nominal pipe sizes from 3⁄8 inch (9.5 mm) to 2 inches (51 mm). It is rarely used today for brand-new building and construction residential plumbing. Steel pipe has National Pipe Thread (NPT) basic tapered male threads, which get in touch with female tapered threads on elbows, tees, couplers, valves, and other fittings. Galvanized steel (typically known simply as "galv" or "iron" in the plumbing trade) is relatively pricey, and challenging to work with due to weight and requirement of a pipe threader It stays in typical use for repair of existing "galv" systems and to satisfy building regulations non-combustibility requirements typically found in hotels, apartment and other commercial applications.

Repiping is the process of replacing old corroded pipes with long-lasting and long lasting new pipes. Because of their resilience and other elements, the brand-new pipes that are used are normally made of copper. Repiping is mostly done on old pipes that were built in the '70s and constructed out of galvanized metals.</p>
