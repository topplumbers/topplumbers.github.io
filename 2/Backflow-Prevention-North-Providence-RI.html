<p>Water softening uses a procedure called "ion exchange" to get rid of dissolved tough water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, manganese and iron. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the tough water flows through the resin, the sodium is switched for the tough water minerals. The hard water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace quantity of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
