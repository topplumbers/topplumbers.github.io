<p>House water softeners, likewise called ion exchange units, are appliances that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. When the resin beads end up being filled with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium option gets rid of the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After going through the beads, the resulting chloride solution becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>

When chemicals are included to a fire security system provided by a potable water supply, increased protection is likewise needed.
