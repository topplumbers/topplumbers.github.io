<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you very first try utilizing non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Just pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. If that doesn't work, you can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. Many of these cleaners contain concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very hazardous if it is available in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If using one of these products, please make sure to take the proper precautions.</p>
