The pipe lining process involves our group saturating a felt liner with a special resin mix. When the felt liner is completely filled, it is pushed through your pipeline. As the liner moves through your pipes, it coats the interior walls, sealing all flaws and fractures. If heat is utilized, the liner is left to solidify in location for several hours or 60 minutes.
