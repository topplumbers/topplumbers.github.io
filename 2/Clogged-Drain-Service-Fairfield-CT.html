<p>In some families, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to technique when searching for a viable option, especially when simple plunging doesn't seem to work. However, there are numerous downsides to using these dangerous products - not least of which is that they typically contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing an obstruction, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of providing the threat of harm to your home and family.</p>
