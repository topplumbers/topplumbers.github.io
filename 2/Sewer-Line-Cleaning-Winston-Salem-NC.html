Due to the huge variety of toilets, we have repaired many toilets in homes throughout the Tampa area so we are extremely familiar with the items used and how they are installed here locally. We also have actually done numerous toilet replacements as well; this is typically required when either a homeowner chooses to replace their toilet with possibly a more efficient one or when a toilet is just beyond repair.</p>
