<p>Loose flanges are typically the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws simply will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best service depends upon the level of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this kind of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
