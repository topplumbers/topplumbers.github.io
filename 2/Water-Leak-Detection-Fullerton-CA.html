<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some elements may have really tight tolerances that need to be preserved. An important thing to identify on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the element. The guide is an extremely critical part of the design of each part. If the component is not fixed correctly, the guide might limit the motion (rather than direct or constant) of the part, which could trigger the component to not work to its abilities. Many times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the component causing lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
