<p>Many homeowners will utilize a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to resolve their clogged or filthy drain issues. These chemicals are simple to use and economical, but they damage your pipes and their effects are just short term.

You, for that reason, have to use a growing number of detergent to accomplish the same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt solution. Difficult minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets renewed with salt ions. The water softener is also cleaned up and decontaminated throughout regeneration.
