<p>Keep in mind that repiping a home is a significant plumbing repair, and you ought to just work with a trusted and well-respected contractor like Cabrillo in order to make sure that the task is done right. The typical cost to install a drip leg is $75 to $150, which is a plumber's minimum charge. For multiple installs, costs range from $33 to $89 per drip leg. Leak legs record moisture so that it does not enter the control unit. Although small pieces of sediment may make it through a drip leg.</p>
<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a great guy. He informed me precisely what to expect (cost, time, procedure) up front and delivered as guaranteed. I will definitely utilize Clog Dawg again. Installing a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with an average per hour rate of $25 to $70. These prices are in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. The total you pay may be higher if your plumber has a minimum callout cost that is greater than the labor cost for the work.</p>
