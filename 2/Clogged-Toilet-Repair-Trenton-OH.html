Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is produced due to the fact that of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
