<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you first shot utilizing non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Simply put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. If that doesn't work, you can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. A lot of these cleaners contain concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very harmful if it can be found in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please make sure to take the suitable precautions if using one of these products.</p>
