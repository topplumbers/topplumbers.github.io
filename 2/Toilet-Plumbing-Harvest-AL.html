<p>You may be concerned when you hear the words whole-house repiping. It seems like an enormous task. It is-- but this is why you hire professional plumbers to do the work. Whole-house repiping takes a couple of days, depending on the size of the house, however plumbers with the abilities and tools can make the work go smoothly and create as little disruption to your life as possible. And once the work is completed, you'll see a big improvement in your house: less obstructions, no water damage, lower water costs. The new plumbing ought to exist doing its task for decades.</p>
<p>Organic particles, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's cable, drain or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself project. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
<p>Longstanding Blockages: Obstructions that continue after you have actually tried to repair them require professional support. Continued efforts by yourself can damage your lines, and you might have a more major underlying problem than you understand. In addition, the longer you delay to call for professional support, the greater the likelihood that you will have sewage back up in your pipes.</p>

How to inform if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and include the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we recommend having them replaced immediately. Prior to you can ask for an inspection, you should first get the required authorization( s) for the work you plan to do. You can check out our Permit page to find out more on getting a permit.

The defected part will either spray or drip profusely, depending on the damage.</p>
