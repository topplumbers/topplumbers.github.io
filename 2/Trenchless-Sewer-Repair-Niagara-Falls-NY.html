<p>Aside from these 2 essential parts, there are a myriad of small, possibly less important things that can break or weaken. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust a lot more rapidly. Consistent gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You may need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising correctly. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. If mishandled, tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by discussing all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in good shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
