For an outdoor gas light or appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can cause a blockage or can cause rust that blocks the line. Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a gas line. Sound-- Gradually sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment ultimately gets difficult and takes away from the capability of your water heater. This solidified sediment is likely the source of the noise.</p>
