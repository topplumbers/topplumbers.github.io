<h3>Why You Need Trustworthy Plumbing Services Burlington KY</h3>
<p>When water is hard, it can clog pipes and soap will liquify in it less easily. Water softening can avoid these unfavorable effects. Gas is a colorless, odorless fuel. As a security preventative measure, we add a chemical odorant called mercaptan that provides natural gas an odor typically related to rotten eggs. If it occurs, this distinctive scent enables you to smell a possible leak. If you presume a leak, always leave.</p>
<p>Breathing in leaked gas in an indoor space, such as your house can result in an absence of oxygen in the air and result in hypoxia. That can, in turn, lead to severe headache, tiredness, decreased vision, short breaths, and even loss of consciousness.
