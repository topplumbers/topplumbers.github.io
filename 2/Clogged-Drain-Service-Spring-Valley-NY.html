In some circumstances, resins can not be washed of pollutants and will need to be replaced. (This must not hold true if the resin is regularly regenerated and maintained.) Consult your water softener dealer for details on resin replacement.</p>
<p>The next requirements to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is essential that the repair service technician understands the right installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be installed in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. The majority of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, but it is necessary that the assembly just be installed if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
