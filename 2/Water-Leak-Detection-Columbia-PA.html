<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
