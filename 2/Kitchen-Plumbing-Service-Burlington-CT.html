If, say, you need a new burner package and the water heater is 5 years of ages, then it makes good sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, particularly if you can do the work yourself.

<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather reasonable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
