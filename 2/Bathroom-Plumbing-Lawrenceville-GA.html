<p>Aside from these 2 important components, there are a myriad of small, perhaps less crucial things that can break or weaken. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust much more rapidly. Consistent gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting effectively, you might need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. Tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part needs to be in great shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
