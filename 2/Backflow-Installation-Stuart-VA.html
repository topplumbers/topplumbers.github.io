<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your home, which makes its plumbing's efficient operating a need more than a need. Once the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair process. It is essential that the plumbing system be switched on really slowly to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air should be eliminated from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system should be examined to guarantee no valves were inadvertently left open or did not close effectively. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are totally open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>
