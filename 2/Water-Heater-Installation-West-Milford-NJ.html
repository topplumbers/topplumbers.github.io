<p>Gently raise the rod and listen if your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod. You might be able to stop the running by changing the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float adjustment screw on top (see Figure A below). Bend the float arm if there is no change screw. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make certain it's adjusted properly (Photo 8). You don't need to empty the tank to make these changes.</p>
<p>In the meantime, nevertheless, we recommend you first try using non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Merely pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. If that does not work, you can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. A number of these cleaners contain focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be really harmful if it is available in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please make sure to take the proper safety measures if utilizing among these items.</p>
