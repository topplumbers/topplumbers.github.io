It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company because they had great evaluations and a fair price, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a fantastic job tidying up after it as well.</p>
