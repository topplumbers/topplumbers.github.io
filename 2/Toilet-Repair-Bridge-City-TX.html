<p>Before the repair service technician begins the repair process, he needs to be sure he has evaluated the workspace around the backflow prevention assembly in order to recognize any restrictive conditions. If the area is considered a confined space, proper security preventative measures must be followed for proper entry. A safe and proper workplace might require the placement of safety barricades or entry constraints around the workspace so the repair specialist or the general public around your work area are not damaged. If the backflow preventer is set up in a restrictive area, this could affect the professional's capability to effectively finish the repair.</p>
<p>Backsiphonage can take place when there is an abrupt reduction in the water pressure of the circulation system, such as during fire battling or when a water pipe breaks. At these occurances, water flow can be reversed. This turnaround can create a suction result and draw potential contaminants into the drinkable (drinking) water supply.
