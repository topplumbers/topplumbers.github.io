<p>Sewer linings can help to repair broken pipes without needing to completely replace your sewer lines or ruin the area around them. Everyday use should not trigger a water softener to leak. Leaks can also happen if you run into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from occurring, install the unit in a steady and safe place. If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the country, protect the softener so that if the foundation starts moving, the softener doesn't tip over and remove the plumbing. You must wait up until after the cycle is finished and then inspected the system for fractures or broken fittings if your water softener is leaking throughout regrowth. You need to also check to make sure your drain line is never ever blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>

The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin.
