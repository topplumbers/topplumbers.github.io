Utilize a solution of baking soda and vinegar occasionally to keep your drains and garbage disposal clean. You can utilize an organic drain cleaner month-to-month to keep your drains clear. We advise natural items, such as Bio-Clean, because they work much better than items including harsh chemicals and will not cause damage to your drains or components.</p>
