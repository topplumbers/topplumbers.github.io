<p>This warranty qualifies and represents all other service warranties to the customer, whether revealed or indicated. This warranty disclaims without limitation suggested warranties of merchantability or physical fitness for a particular purpose or treatment of particular water conditions. Whether you need to prepare food, clean your hands, take in the shower or a hot bath, or just mop the floor, both your household water heating unit and the circulation of natural gas contribute important aspects to your household's level of daily convenience and benefit.</p>
<p>If your house uses around 45 gallons of warm water every day, the on-demand gas heater can conserve as much as 35% of the energy needed for heated water. They can also minimize the energy required for homes with far higher requirements also. Residences that utilize over 80 gallons of warm water each day can conserve as much as 14% by changing to these smaller water heaters. It is estimated that an average family can save as much as $100 each year by changing to the tankless heater.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates information on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test data means for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester analyzes the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
