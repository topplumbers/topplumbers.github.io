<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and an excellent man. He informed me precisely what to expect (cost, time, process) up front and provided as guaranteed. I will definitely use Clog Dawg once again. Setting up a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical per hour rate of $25 to $70. These prices are in addition to the cost of the disposal system. The total you pay may be greater if your plumber has a minimum callout fee that is greater than the labor cost for the work.</p>
<p>If you observe low water pressure or stained water, it usually signifies rust and mineral accumulation. As rust and minerals build up in time, they constrict the circulation of the water which is why you may observe lower water pressure. The staining happens when rust ends up being loose from the pipes and flow into your water system, affecting the water quality. Having plumbing pipes that have rust or deterioration can become a health risk in your water.</p>
<p>Your waste disposal unit makes sure that your sink and plumbing fixtures don't get clogged. Contrary to some people's understanding, garbage disposals do not include blades. Instead, a waste disposal unit features 2 stationary bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts require food and particles to grind versus a stationary grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action efficiently pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without obstructing.</p>
