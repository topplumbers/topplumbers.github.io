Inspecting the water meter is a terrific next action in your plumbing inspection. Close all faucets and inspect if the water meter is turning. There is a leak somewhere and this might be major issue if it is. Move on to the valves. Start with the main turned off valve operation. When shut down, no faucet in your home should have water.
