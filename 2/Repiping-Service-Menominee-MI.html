A plumber will insert a specially created waterproof camera through your sewer line and capture live footage to determine where and what the source of the problem is.</p>
<p>Your house's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not actually the circulation of water pushing them down your pipes. Rather, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. When something obstructs the pipes, anything you pour down there won't go through.</p>
