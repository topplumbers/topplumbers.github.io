<p>Commercial toilets and urinals are a few of the most crucial features of a business. If toilets and urinals do not run appropriately, consumers can leave your organisation with an unfavorable impression.

This does not include the rate of the toilet, which averages $ 99 to $199, for a total toilet replacement cost of $ 221 to $427. A high-efficiency toilet with additional features can cost $ 800 to $1,500 to install. The average installation takes a plumber 2 to 4 hours at $ 65 per hour. If you're changing an existing toilet, include $ 30 to $50 to remove your old toilet.</p>
<p>Fed up with standing in inches of water while you shower? Wondering if that slowly-draining toilet suggests difficulty even more down the sewer line? Contact us for total drain cleaning services. We will detect the problem and clear the line before a backup causes expensive damage to your home or company. Day after day, every year that sediment will continue to build up triggering issues down roadway.
