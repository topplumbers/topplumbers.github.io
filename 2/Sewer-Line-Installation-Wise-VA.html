When it rains, any excess water is supposed to go down a storm drain in order to prevent flooding problems. If you are currently experiencing any flooding on your property when it rains, then there is a great chance that the storm drain is clogged and for that reason needs to be cleared out. If a clogged storm drain is not addressed in a prompt way, the chances are high that it will trigger additional damage to the storm pipe, which will need repair.</p>
<p>Inspect Valves and Dual Checks. There are two other types of backflow preventers available that you may run into. The very first is a check valve. The 2nd is a double check". It is NOT the same thing as a Check even though it may be marketed as one! Don't get ripped off! Pressure loss through a check valve tends to be about 3 PSI. Double Checks have losses similar to Check (5 PSI).</p>

<p>When you see a diagram of the working parts, Toilet repair can look deceptively simple. You think, Sure, I can do that," but read the instructions carefully.
