<p>Aside from these 2 essential elements, there are a myriad of small, possibly less important things that can break or degrade. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away a lot more quickly.

You might need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting correctly. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. Tank lids can break and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom.
