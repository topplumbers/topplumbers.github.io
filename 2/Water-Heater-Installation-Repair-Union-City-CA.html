<p>No, you ought to NOT pour caustic chemical drain cleaners down your drains if you're major about protecting your drain and plumbing system. The reason is that these chemical cleaners can be far more destructive than practical, possibly gnawing at your pipes. Repiping is the replacement of either a single pipe or a home's whole plumbing system, consisting of both water supply and drain lines. Generally, a whole-house repipe is worth the investment in the long run since it might address the root reason for the persistent plumbing problems in your home.</p>
<p>Organic debris, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's drain, snake or cable auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's DIY project. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
