<p>With tankless electrical heaters, water is warmed directly whenever it's required. Tankless systems specifically use a component that warms up water when the tap is switched on. The water is continually heated as long as the tap remains on. The water stops being heated if the tap is immediately switched off. The heating temperature level is generally pre-set to suit your needs and preferences. Since they just heat water when required, tankless electrical water heaters use less power than conventional water heaters.</p>
