<p>Backflow is a potential problem in a water system because it can spread out contaminated water back through a circulation system. For example, backflow at unrestrained cross connections (cross-connections are any actual or potential connection between the public water supply and a source of contamination or pollution) can enable pollutants or contaminants to enter the drinkable water system. Sickness can result from ingesting water that has actually been infected due to backflow.</p>

<p>Pieces that comprise kitchen sink drains can become used and rusty, resulting in leakages. Depending on the intensity of the circumstance, only one piece may need replacement, or the whole under-sink assembly must be gotten rid of and replaced. Parts involved consist of slip nut joints and washers, tubing leading from the sink, P-trap or S-trap assemblies and sink drain baskets. Incorrectly installed P-traps or S-traps that are propped up or are not secured by nut joints and washers, should be reconfigured.</p>

When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When hard water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
