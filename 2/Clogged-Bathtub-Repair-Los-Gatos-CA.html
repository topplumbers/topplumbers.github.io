<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some components may have very tight tolerances that need to be maintained. A crucial thing to recognize on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the part. The guide is a very important part of the style of each part. If the component is not repaired appropriately, the guide could restrict the motion (instead of direct or constant) of the element, which could cause the element to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the component triggering lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
