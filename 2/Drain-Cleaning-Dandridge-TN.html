<p>You probably know something about your drains: they take water from your bathtubs, sinks, and showers to a local water treatment center. When drains are working correctly that's really all you need to understand about them, but when something goes wrong, you need to have a deeper understanding of what sort of problems can occur in pipes and how to fix them without doing more damage. That's where a professional plumber comes in-- they have the proficiency to identify an issue and the tools and knowledge to fix it.</p>
<p>Do not use ground joint unions other than straight at the meter or after the shutoff valve at the device. Each place where you will have a gas device must have a gas shutoff valve. Within the City of Seattle only, anybody who sets up gas piping on residential or commercial property not under their ownership need to have a Seattle Gas Piping Mechanic License. All gas piping setups require a permit and inspection.</p>
