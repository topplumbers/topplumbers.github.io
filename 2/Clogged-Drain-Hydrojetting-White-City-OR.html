<p>Depending on your scenario, your plumber may utilize one or a combination of piping product throughout your house repiping project. Copper is standard since it's long-lasting, can endure fires, and withstands weather. Nevertheless, copper is difficult to install, which implies greater labor expenses.

PEX also withstands rust and freezing better than metal pipes. Your residential plumbing company will decide which material is best depending on your needs.</p>
<p>Tank to Tank installation: On average, changing a gas or electric water tank with a similar design takes two to three hours. It takes between 45 to 60 minutes to drain, detach and eliminate your old water heater.
