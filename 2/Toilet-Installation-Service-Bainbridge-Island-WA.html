<p>An overall repipe of a home's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most complex and pricey plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in whole home repiping. For an outdoor gas light or appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger a blockage or can trigger deterioration that blocks the line. Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a natural gas line. Noise-- In time sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank. This sediment ultimately gets difficult and takes away from the capability of your hot water heater. This hardened sediment is most likely the source of the noise.</p>
