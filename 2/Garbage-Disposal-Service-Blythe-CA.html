<p>The person who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not needed to obtain this accreditation. I have actually talked to a few plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, however I would expect the rate to be substantially less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>

<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the previous. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite reasonable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly delighted with their service.</p>

<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to technique when looking for a feasible service, specifically when simple plunging does not seem to work. However, there are many drawbacks to using these hazardous products - not least of which is that they usually contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a clog, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of providing the danger of harm to your home and family.</p>
