<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some elements may have extremely tight tolerances that have to be maintained. A crucial thing to identify on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the element. The guide is a very critical part of the design of each component. If the component is not repaired correctly, the guide might restrict the motion (rather than constant or direct) of the component, which might trigger the element to not work to its capabilities. Sometimes springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the part causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
