<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some parts might have very tight tolerances that need to be kept. An essential thing to determine on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the part. The guide is a really critical part of the design of each element. If the element is not fixed appropriately, the guide could restrict the movement (instead of direct or stable) of the component, which could cause the component to not work to its abilities. Sometimes springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are restricting the travel of the element causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
