<p>There's a good opportunity you have galvanized pipes if you have an older house. And if your house was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing completion of their life-span. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to rust. This corrosion can result in an accumulation of lead, which can have many negative results on your health. Corroded pipes also result in poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>While pipe lining is a fantastic option for the majority of people, there are some scenarios where repiping is the only alternative. Repiping is the process of replacing old rusty pipes with lasting and long lasting new pipes. Since of their sturdiness and other factors, the new pipes that are used are normally made of copper. Repiping is mostly done on old pipes that were integrated in the '70s and made out of galvanized metals.</p>
