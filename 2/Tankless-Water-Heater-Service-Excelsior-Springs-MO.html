<p>The great news is that it doesn't necessarily require a repair of your entire system if you think your toilet has a leak. A toilet's tank is composed of numerous small moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be changed or repaired due to their frequent use. When these parts wear out, they result in small leakages that are difficult to see with the naked eye. This is why it is essential to call a plumber as soon as you suspect you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not only does a leaking toilet waste water, it can also result in flooding and water damage.</p>
