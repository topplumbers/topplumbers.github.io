The membrane has pores large enough to admit water molecules for passage; hardness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft water supply is without solidity ions with no other ions being included. Membranes are a type of water filter requiring regular cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
