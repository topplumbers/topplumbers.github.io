<p>The secret to preventing a clogged garbage disposal is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at a reasonable amount, there need to be no problem in getting most of the waste through. There are a couple of food products you must probably not take into the garbage disposal though. Those items are coffee premises, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another suggestion to stop blocking is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are completed cleaning to ensure the drain is clear.</p>
