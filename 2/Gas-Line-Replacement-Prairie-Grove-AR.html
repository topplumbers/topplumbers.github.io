Safe and clean and non-potable water or liquids can be forced into the potable supply system if these connections are not correctly protected.</p>
<p>This might sound like a joke, but it's extremely serious if you want to genuinely get the most out of your investment. Start by requesting a copy of the plumbing inspection list.

A backflow preventer not only safeguards drinking water in private residences, it likewise avoids wastewater in private homes from flowing back out and polluting the public water system.</p>
