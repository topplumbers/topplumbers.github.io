<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod, carefully listen and raise the rod. You might be able to stop the running by adjusting the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A below). Flex the float arm if there is no change screw. Make sure it's adjusted effectively (Image 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You don't need to clear the tank to make these modifications.</p>
