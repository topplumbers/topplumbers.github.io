<p>Often, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates information on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test data indicates for that particular assembly.  When a skilled tester interprets the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
