<p>Aside from these two crucial parts, there are a myriad of little, possibly less crucial things that can weaken or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust far more quickly. Constant gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising properly, you might need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. Tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in great shape for it to work at its best.</p>

They need approximately 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, due to the fact that the heatpump is on top of the water heater. Also, hybrids need approximately 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to capture enough heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to release the condensate.</p>
