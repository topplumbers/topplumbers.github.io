When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When difficult water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>There are other advantages to water softening, also. It is a well established technology that has actually been used in homes for practically 65 years. The equipment is reliable, effective, and widely offered, providing consumers with convenient features and a selective market.
