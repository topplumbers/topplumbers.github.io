<p>Remodeling plumbers generally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Once again, this does not consist of the cost of parts. However more and more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly spend much more. With this approach, you know the turnkey price going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates information on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to understand what the field test information indicates for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester interprets the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
