If you choose to hunt for a washer, eliminate it and take it to the shop to find a match. Plumbers usually replace the whole fill valve rather than hunt for a replacement washer.</p>

This can produce cross-connection control problems and may as an outcome mean that the level of defense on the fire protection system may need to be increased to a high hazard security level.</p>
