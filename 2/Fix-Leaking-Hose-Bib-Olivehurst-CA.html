A licensed professional can help you identify if your structure requires a backflow preventer or several devices, or if you qualify for an exemption. Exemptions, which are given in very uncommon cases where the structure is considered to not pose a danger to the water system, must be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you must have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, in addition to an initial test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
