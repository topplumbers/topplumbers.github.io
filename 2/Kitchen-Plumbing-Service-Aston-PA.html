<p>No other room in a house contains as lots of pipes and plumbing components as the bathroom. Prevention is better than remedy. If you have a well or a watering system, you need to install a backflow device on your water supply. Discolored water- Your water should always be clear.

It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside shut off remains in the closed position. This enables the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in an accurate movement. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air should be removed from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from critical areas in the assembly. In some designs, test dicks can be used to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will collect.</p>

Backflow can take place in a number of situations that may draw water from locations such as garden water fountains, pool, or sprinkler system systems into City water system lines. If it is connected to any outside water source, Backflow can also bring water into your plumbing. One example would be a garden hose connected to an external faucet with completion left in a mud puddle in a garden area.</p>
<p>We have an inspection program to identify water sources and scenarios that require backflow prevention devices. For home, it is necessary for owners to alert the District if any changes are made, such as digging a brand-new well. For commercial property, the District reviews using each new tenant. If the present backflow is not up to District code, the correction should be made before water service is permitted. Cost for the device is covered by either the tenant or the home owner.</p>

Both include a mechanical backflow preventer - basically, a physical barrier to the backflow.
