<p>Deluge systems are created so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized.

Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
