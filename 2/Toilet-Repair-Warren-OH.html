<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather sensible. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
