<p>The salt water tank aids the water softening system in regrowth. It is a shorter tank that sits surrounding to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds a highly concentrated solution of salt (or in some cases potassium) to bring back the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is manually contributed to the brine tank in the form of blocks or pellets. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capacity of the resin is lessening, the heavy salt water option is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. The water passing through the system will no longer be softened if the salt water tank runs out of salt.</p>
<p>Organic debris, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's cable television, drain or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's DIY job. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leaks - so it deserves it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
