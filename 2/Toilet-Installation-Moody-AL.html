Backflow preventers are needed in fire protection systems by the 2018 edition of the Uniform Plumbing Code, the design code developed by the International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Authorities (IAPMO) to promote the public's health, security, and welfare by governing the installation and inspection of plumbing systems.</p>
<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high threat" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, but also has a 3rd check valve that is in fact a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk scenarios is since if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve uses an additional layer of protection compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you check an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
