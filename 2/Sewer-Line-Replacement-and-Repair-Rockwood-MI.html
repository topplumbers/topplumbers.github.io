<p>Viking SupplyNet's substantial inventory of backflow valves and associated gadgets consists of leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water system respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and end up being brittle. This results in micro-fractures and lowers the basic structural stability of the system. The system becomes weak and may fail without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Incorrect installation is also a common cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to identify.</p>

<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of 2 categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a predetermined schedule and after that return to service. These work well for families that are on routine water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt since they regrow whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control designs, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, normally restore after many gallons of water have actually been softened. If you have a changing water use schedule, such designs are practical.</p>
