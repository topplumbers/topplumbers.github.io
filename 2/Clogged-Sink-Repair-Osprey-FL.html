If your sewer lines are below trees, near extensive landscaping, sidewalks, driveways or other semi-permanent features, overall sewer excavation can trigger a great deal of collateral damage (and expenditure) to the surrounding area.</p>
<p>Lots of home owners install gas lines for gas ranges, furnaces, fireplaces or other gas operable devices in the house. Gas lines deliver the natural energy source to the home safely.
