However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is a choice to think about if you reside in an older house - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for many decades, however steel ultimately struggles with deterioration and lacks the toughness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
