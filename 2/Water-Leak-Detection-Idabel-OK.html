<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
