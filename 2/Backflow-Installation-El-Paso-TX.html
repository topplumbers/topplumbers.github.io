<p>Often caused by slow seepage from the tank into the bowl. Put a few drops of food coloring in the tank. Wait an hour, then inspect and see if you see coloring in the bowl. This shows a leaky flapper valve. Replacement is generally the fix. Alternatively, often a faulty fill valve might actuate intermittently, too. Water will not drain or is draining gradually through the disposal.</p>
<p>Often, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces information on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to know what the field test data means for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
