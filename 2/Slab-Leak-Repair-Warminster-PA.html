Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is created since of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact between the different metals.
