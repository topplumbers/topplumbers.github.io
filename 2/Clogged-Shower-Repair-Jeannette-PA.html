<p>Deluge systems are created so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems generally are installed in locations where the possibility of a serious fire condition is likely, such as airplane garages.

If a fire happens, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then permits water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
