<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming drinkable water supply. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or decreased pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common kind of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
