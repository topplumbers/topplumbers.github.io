<p>The economics of new high-efficiency water softeners. The professional turned off the water supply and loosened up the bolts that were holding the toilet to the floor. He was then able to get rid of the pipe to clear the clog and reattach the pipe to the toilet fixture. The customer helped our specialist in moving the toilet back into its proper area, and the service technician tightened up the bolts before restoring the supply of water and guaranteeing that the toilet was effectively flushing.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing needs to be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not required to obtain this certification.
