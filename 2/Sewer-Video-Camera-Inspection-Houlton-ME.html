<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the normal solution is to have the defective pipes changed. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is an option to consider if you reside in an older home - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for lots of decades, but steel ultimately struggles with deterioration and lacks the sturdiness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
