<p>Brine Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Features automated shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is almost certainly from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or gas is very low. Rainwater which has not filtered through the earth is a remarkably pure form of water. When water evaporates it leaves behind dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when evaporated water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
