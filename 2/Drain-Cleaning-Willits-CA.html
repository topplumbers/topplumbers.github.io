<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned up rapidly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, producing from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to eliminate debris such as hard water scale, sand, grease, and silt deposits.</p>
