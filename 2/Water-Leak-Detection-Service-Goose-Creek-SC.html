<p>The excellent news is that it doesn't always need a repair of your whole unit if you think your toilet has a leak. A toilet's tank is composed of several little moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be changed or fixed due to their regular use. When these parts wear, they lead to small leaks that are difficult to see with the naked eye. This is why it is important to call a plumber as soon as you suspect you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not only does a leaking toilet waste water, it can also cause flooding and water damage.</p>

<p>Loose flanges are generally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws just will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends on the extent of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this sort of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
