<p>Replacing your sink is a detailed process. Step, cut, and link the pipes. Prior to connecting any pipes to your water softener, step and cut your pipes to fit. If you are utilizing copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings prior to connecting the unit to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can likewise be utilized. Though it might require additional adapters, flexible tubing is far much easier to deal with and can use push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the hassle of soldering.</p>
