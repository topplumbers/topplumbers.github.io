<p>The next criteria to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is important that the repair specialist knows the appropriate installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. Many backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is important that the assembly only be set up if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work since the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
