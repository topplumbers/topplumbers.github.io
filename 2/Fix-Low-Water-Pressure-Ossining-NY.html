<p>In some families, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to method when searching for a practical solution, especially when easy plunging doesn't seem to work. However, there are numerous disadvantages to utilizing these hazardous items - not least of which is that they typically consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing an obstruction, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, however at the cost of presenting the risk of harm to your home and family.</p>
