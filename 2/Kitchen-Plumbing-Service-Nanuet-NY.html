<p>Organic particles, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's snake, drain or cable television auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's DIY task. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
