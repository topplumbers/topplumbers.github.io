<p>Water softening makes use of a procedure called "ion exchange" to eliminate liquified hard water minerals such as calcium, manganese, iron and magnesium. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required.

The tough water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace quantity of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>

They need as much as 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, because the heatpump is on top of the hot water heater. Likewise, hybrids need approximately 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to catch adequate heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to discharge the condensate.</p>
