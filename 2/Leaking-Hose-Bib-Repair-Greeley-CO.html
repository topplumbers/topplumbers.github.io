<p>As soon as the components are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is essential to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the disadvantage shut down stays in the closed position. This allows the parts to move to their pressurized positions in an accurate movement. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air needs to be eliminated from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from crucial areas in the assembly. In some designs, test cocks can be used to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will accumulate.</p>
<p>Most softeners have a bypass developed into the outlet and the inlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in case you need to provide some type of maintenance to it or even while you're dealing with installing it.
