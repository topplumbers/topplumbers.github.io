<p>Viking SupplyNet's extensive stock of backflow valves and related devices includes leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water supply respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become brittle. This results in micro-fractures and reduces the basic structural integrity of the system. The system ends up being weak and may stop working without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal effects. Incorrect installation is likewise a typical cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly difficult to detect.</p>
