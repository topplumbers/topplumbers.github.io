<p>If you need a water softener is an individual choice, figuring out. Water softener systems work by removing hardness minerals and replacing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are devices that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to prevent the scale from building up by reducing the effects of the hardness itself. Due to the reality that water conditioners utilize a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are in some cases considered a greener alternative in areas where it is prohibited to use salt. Water conditioners do not efficiently eliminate solidity from the water supply, however, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>

<p>In some cases, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces information on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test data implies for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester interprets the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
