<p>If you discover low water pressure or tarnished water, it usually represents rust and mineral buildup. As rust and minerals develop over time, they constrict the flow of the water which is why you might see lower water pressure. The discoloration takes place when rust becomes loose from the pipes and circulation into your water supply, impacting the water quality. Having plumbing pipes that have rust or deterioration can end up being a health threat in your water.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you very first shot using non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Simply put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. You can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that doesn't work. Many of these cleaners include concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be really harmful if it is available in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If utilizing one of these products, please make sure to take the suitable precautions.</p>
