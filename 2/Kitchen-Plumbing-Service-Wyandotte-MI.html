<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

<h3>The Many Services Provided By Residential Plumbers Wyandotte MI</h3>

If your building has an existing backflow preventer, however the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, in addition to a preliminary test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
