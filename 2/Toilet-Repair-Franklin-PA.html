Invasive tree roots can cause significant plumbing problems, especially in older areas with clay sewer lines.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are typically the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends on the degree of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this sort of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
<p>If you have a waste disposal unit, you can try disposing a tray of ice down the drain, and after that switch on the garbage disposal while running water. This will knock off any food particles stuck in the disposal, and the salt will scrub it too. Leaking kitchen faucet, bathroom faucet, laundry faucet or exhausted, worn out sink? No issue is too great for our highly trained plumbers. From a sink replacement, to a faucet repair or upgrade, our experienced plumbing team gets the job done quickly and economically.</p>
