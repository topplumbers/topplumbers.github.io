<p>Your waste disposal unit makes sure that your sink and plumbing components don't get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's understanding, garbage disposals do not include blades. Rather, a garbage disposal features 2 stationary bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts require food and debris to grind against a fixed grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action effectively pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without clogging.</p>
