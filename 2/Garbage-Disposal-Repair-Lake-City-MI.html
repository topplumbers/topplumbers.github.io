<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey stated that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are quite popular with homeowners in the area. He kept in mind that there are specific pollutants that citizens are dealing with and an RO can help ease those concerns. Due to being mostly agricultural in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some property owners are installing ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are a product of agricultural waste.

<p>A cross-connection is any momentary or permanent connection between a public water system or consumer's potable (i.e., drinking) water system and any source or system containing nonpotable water or other substances. An example is the piping between a public water system or consumer's potable water supply and an auxiliary water system, cooling system or irrigation system.</p>
