<h3>Plumbers And House Plumbing San Bernardino CA</h3>
<p>The most efficient way to deal with difficult water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When tough water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at approximately 3,500 PSI. This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned rapidly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, discharging from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to eliminate debris such as tough water scale, sand, silt, and grease deposits.</p>
