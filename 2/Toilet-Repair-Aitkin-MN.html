<p>Your storm drains do not go straight into the ground and into oblivion either, this water is typically channelled elsewhere to a nearby treatment plant, a creek, or even the ocean in.

<p>Some pipe materials are less expensive than others; some are more prone and brittle to cracking, displacement or other types of structural failure. Other materials are susceptible to deterioration and rust while some are unaffected.
