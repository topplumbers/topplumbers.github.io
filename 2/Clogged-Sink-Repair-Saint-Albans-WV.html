<p>When sewer line breaks, it often triggers the lawn above it to become soaked. You might smell the horrible smell of sewage before you feel the squish of your yard under your feet (hopefully shoed feet!). A sinkhole can form, making it required to cordon off that portion of your yard. Because the swampiness will draw in unwelcome animals, the circumstance is filled with problems. Plumbers refer to a sewer line break as a plumbing emergency. Hopefully, your Evanston plumber's contact number is on your speed dial.</p>
