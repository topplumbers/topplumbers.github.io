<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable water system pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
<p>The kinds of backflow preventers the company supplies include double check valve assemblies, check detector assemblies (including stainless-steel designs), and reduced pressure zone assemblies.
