<p>Aside from these 2 crucial elements, there are a myriad of little, possibly less vital things that can degrade or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away much more quickly. Constant gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting effectively, you may need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. Tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by mentioning all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part needs to be in great shape for it to function at its best.</p>

Our staff will examine your system and detect any repair problems. Lots of minor problems can quickly be fixed with a quality repair. Furthermore, we offer hot water heater maintenance to keep your system operating in top shape.</p>

They were fantastic at fixing the clogged drain, however really very careless about repairing the chip in the sink and the use of puddy under the sink.</p>
