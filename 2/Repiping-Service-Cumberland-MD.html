<p>Aside from these two important elements, there are a myriad of small, maybe less important things that can degrade or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust far more rapidly. Continuous gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising effectively, you may need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. If mishandled, tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by pointing out all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part requires to be in great shape for it to operate at its best.</p>

<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod, gently lift the rod and listen. You might be able to stop the running by changing the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A listed below). If there is no adjustment screw, flex the float arm. Make sure it's changed effectively (Image 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You don't need to clear the tank to make these changes.</p>
<p>Sewer problems are the last thing homeowner wish to get their hands filthy with.
