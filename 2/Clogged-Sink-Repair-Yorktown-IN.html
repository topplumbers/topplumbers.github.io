It is necessary to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Fluctuations in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will prompt a correctly operating RPZ assembly to periodically discharge small amounts of water. During a backflow condition, a large volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be set up in areas based on water damage. Appropriate drainage must likewise be offered.</p>
