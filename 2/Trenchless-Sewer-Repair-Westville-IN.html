<p>Backflow implies the unfavorable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they must be carefully created and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
