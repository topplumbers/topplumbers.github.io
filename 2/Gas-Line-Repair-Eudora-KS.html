<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to just abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason that we will recommend a full repipe in particular areas, based on our experience.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
