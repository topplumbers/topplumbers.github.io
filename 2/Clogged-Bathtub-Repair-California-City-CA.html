<p>Whether a water supply is identified "soft" or "hard" is dependent on the presence of two highly soluble minerals, calcium and magnesium. From a health standpoint, these minerals have no negative impacts and are, in truth, important everyday nutrients. It is minerals that provide water the rejuvenating taste many people discover desirable. However, when calcium and magnesium penetrate water, they accumulation on contact surface areas, potentially plug pipes and damage hot water heater, and decrease the effectiveness of soaps and detergents. At this moment the water is said to be hard.</p>
<p>The Battelle Research study also discovered difficult water to quickly cause clogged shower heads, in some cases after just a year and a half of regular usage.
