Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
