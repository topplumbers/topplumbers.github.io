The pink film is really a harmless bacteria that originates from the sea salt. If this stain is an annoyance in your house, the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) recommends switching to among the other two types of salts.

Garbage disposals are pretty simple to keep. The most important thing to bear in mind is that they are really food disposals.
