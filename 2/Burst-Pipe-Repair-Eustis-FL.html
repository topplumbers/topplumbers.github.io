<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the difficult water is softened. The water supply line feeds the hard water into the tank. The water permeates through the bed of resin beads, transferring the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and flows through your pipes and out to your household home appliances. Backflow is a term used in the plumbing world to explain an unwanted circulation of water in the reverse instructions. The backflow of water brings impurities back to the main water system system, making the water in it risky to consume.</p>
