<p>Kitchen sinks are constantly vulnerable to obstructions with food and grease being the significant perpetrators. They congeal to the piping walls if fats are poured down the sink.

Their crushing strength stops the water flow, requiring plumbers to find and repair the concern for typical home plumbing operations. You need your drain cleaned before it leads to more damage and even more expensive repairs if this is what is taking place to your home.</p>
