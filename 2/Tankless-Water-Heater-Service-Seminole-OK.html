<p>Echologics has a long history of developing award-winning acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (usually from your home to its connection to the public sewer system) can be utilized to examine the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, clogs, corrosion or collapsed pipes. Homeowners may have a video inspection done to find the reason for regular sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when offering or buying an older house.</p>
<p>Set out the new disposal and parts in preparation for installation. I've been to numerous carwashes that have a softener, and to the surprise of the owners, the water tests hard even after having gone through the softener.
