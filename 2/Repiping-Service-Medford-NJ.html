<p>Another typical argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves need to avoid backflow.  The apparent problem with this is that if the backflow happens at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic manually operated valve ought to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless most of the automatic valves, such as the electric solenoid valves used for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
<p>Usage of tankless systems in second homes eliminates dangers of water damage. Standard hot water tanks have danger of leaking, which can cause pricey damage repairs, especially when left ignored. A tankless hot water heater has no threat of leaking a full tank of water and causing harm.
