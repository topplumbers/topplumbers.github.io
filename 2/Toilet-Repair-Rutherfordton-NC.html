<p>As a locally-owned company, integrity and obligation are incredibly crucial to developing a track record for excellence. Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Section 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses defense of the safe and clean water supply within a structure these devices are referred to as isolation" BFP. Once again, the best type of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub.
