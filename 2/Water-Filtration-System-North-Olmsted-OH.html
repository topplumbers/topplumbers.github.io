<p>You most likely know one thing about your drains: they take water from your showers, sinks, and bathtubs to a local water treatment facility. When drains are working properly that's really all you need to understand about them, however when something goes wrong, you need to have a deeper understanding of what sort of problems can take place in pipes and how to fix them without doing more damage. That's where a professional plumber comes in-- they have the knowledge to detect an issue and the tools and knowledge to fix it.</p>
<p>It helps to know the brand and design of your toilet. The trademark name is normally on the bowl behind the seat. In some cases, the model or number will be on the underside of the cover or inside the tank. Matching an unusual flapper can become a trial-and-error process. Even professional plumbers in some cases try 2 or 3 flappers before they discover one that works well.</p>
