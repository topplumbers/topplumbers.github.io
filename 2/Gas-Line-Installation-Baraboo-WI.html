<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some components might have extremely tight tolerances that need to be kept. A crucial thing to identify on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the part. The guide is an extremely vital part of the design of each element. If the component is not repaired correctly, the guide could restrict the movement (instead of direct or steady) of the element, which could cause the part to not work to its capabilities. Often times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are restricting the travel of the part triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
