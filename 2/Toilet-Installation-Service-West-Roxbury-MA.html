<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and an excellent guy. He told me precisely what to anticipate (cost, time, process) up front and provided as assured. I will definitely use Clog Dawg again. Installing a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical hourly rate of $25 to $70. These costs are in addition to the cost of the disposal system. If your plumber has a minimum callout fee that is higher than the labor cost for the work, the total you pay might be higher.</p>
<p>Although it might be appealing to gather over-the-counter drain-clearing items, lots of plumbers advise against it. Not only are the chemicals hazardous if exposed to human skin, they may likewise damage drain pipes if excessive used. There are additional concerns that may come up, which is why our knowledgeable plumbers will perform a thorough inspection of your system to determine what has triggered it to breakdown. From there we can make an informed decision on whether your problem can be fixed by a basic repair or if replacing the garbage disposal is ultimately the better choice.</p>
<p>Your waste disposal unit guarantees that your sink and plumbing fixtures don't get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's understanding, garbage disposals do not include blades. Instead, a waste disposal unit includes two fixed bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts force food and debris to grind versus a stationary mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action effectively crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without clogging.</p>
