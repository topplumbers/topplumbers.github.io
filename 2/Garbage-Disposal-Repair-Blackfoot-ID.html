<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine proved successful, Sam Blanc designed and developed a smaller sized model that operated on the exact same concept but might clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains as well as laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc also built a much bigger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be hauled by a truck and included a 10 hp fuel engine and 1000 feet of steel cable. It was capable of cleaning large industrial and community sewer pipes. An enhanced version called "The Mainliner" was introduced in 1958 that might also thread telephone cable television. It was discontinued in 1973.</p>
