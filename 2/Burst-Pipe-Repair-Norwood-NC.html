<p>The function of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to ensure that all plumbing installed throughout building and construction of a brand-new or renovated structure is set up by knowledgeable craftsmen in accordance with appropriate codes. Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you clean your hands, clean the dishes, or pour flat soda in your sink, you typically understand your drain is clogged and needs cleaning. However, when a clogged drain materializes through flooding, the clog is more than likely in the draining fixture itself. Blockages in a fixture can cause damaging damage to your draining system the longer they continue.</p>

The intent of electrical inspection is to ensure compliance with the appropriate electrical code in order to lower individual, and structural electrical threats.
