<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
