The brine tank holds a highly focused solution of salt (or in some cases potassium) to restore the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is by hand added to the salt water tank in the type of blocks or pellets. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve signs up the softening capability of the resin is lessening, the heavy salt water solution is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.

Considering that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one advantage declared for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promo have actually been claimed, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only change the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of certain systems has shown a reduction of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
