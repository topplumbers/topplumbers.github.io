<p>Strange Sounds - If unusual gurgling is originating from your drain, it most likely needs a thorough cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it challenging for the water to pass through. The pipes frequently make odd gurgling sounds as water efforts to pass through a clogged pipe because of the tight area. This triggers the water to bubble, as just little pockets of air are accessible, resulting in the strange sounds originating from your sink.</p>
