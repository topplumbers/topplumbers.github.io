Water conditioners are gadgets that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to inhibit the scale from building up by reducing the effects of the hardness itself. Due to the reality that water conditioners use a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are often considered a greener alternative in areas where it is forbidden to use salt.
