<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a couple of things you can do to keep your drains clear. Prevent putting grease or oil down the drains. Use an option of baking soda and vinegar regularly to keep your drains and waste disposal unit clean. You can use an organic drain cleaner monthly to keep your drains clear. We recommend organic products, such as Bio-Clean, since they work better than products containing harsh chemicals and won't trigger damage to your drains or components.</p>
<p>The pipe-bursting technique is utilized on pipes that are significantly damaged, for changing an entire pipe system, or for repairing bigger sections of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to start repair, that includes two four foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers begin by positioning a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and drawing in a brand-new seamless pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic material that will be resistant to root intrusion for as much as 100 years.</p>
