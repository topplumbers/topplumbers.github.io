<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. Once the resin beads end up being filled with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride solution becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
<p>So now that you understand you have a backup in your main line, how do you clear it? Sadly, main line blockages are not something a property owner can fix. This type of clog requires a professional plumber or drain professional to utilize a drain cleaning machine to locate the clog and get it cleared.
