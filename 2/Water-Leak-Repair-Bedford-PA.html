<p>Backflow is the unwanted turnaround of circulation in a potable water distribution system. Water that is always under pressure can just flow in one direction. Then how can water circulation in reverse? Water will constantly stream toward the point of least expensive pressure.

The need upstream could trigger a reversal in circulation.</p>
<p>You probably understand one thing about your drains: they take water from your sinks, showers, and bathtubs to a local water treatment center.
