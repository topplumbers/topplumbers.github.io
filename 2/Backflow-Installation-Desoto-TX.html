Copper is standard because it's long-lasting, can endure fires, and withstands weather condition. Nevertheless, copper is hard to install, which means greater labor expenses.

<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are devices that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. As soon as the resin beads end up being loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After going through the beads, the resulting chloride option becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
