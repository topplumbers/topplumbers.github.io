<p>Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather sensible. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely pleased with their service.</p>
