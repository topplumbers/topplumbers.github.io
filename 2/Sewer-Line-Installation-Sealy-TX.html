<p>Foul Sewer Smell: One of the first most obvious signs of a sewer issue is a smell of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the yard (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be a basic problem such as a broken water seal, or it can indicate a bigger problem such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can prevent major damage to your house. Even if the issue comes from with the local system, it's still smart to generate the experts to limit the damage to your house.</p>

<p>Purchasing a house is a big financial investment. Understanding if you have galvanized pipes, copper drain pipes, lead closet bends, or an inferior piping system can be handy when working out the sale of a house.
