Water softeners normally utilize sodium (Na+) as the exchange ion. Salt ions are provided from liquified salt chloride salt, also called brine. In the ion exchange process, sodium ions are utilized to coat an exchange medium in the softener The exchange medium can be natural zeolites" or artificial resin beads that look like damp sand.</p>
<p>Clogged toilets are among the most common plumbing problems plumbers face, and for many individuals, it's an emergency when the toilet is all set to overflow. You can attempt to fix the clog yourself by using a plunger, which you can buy at your local hardware store. The only function of salt in a water softener is to regenerate the resin beads that take the solidity out of water.</p>
