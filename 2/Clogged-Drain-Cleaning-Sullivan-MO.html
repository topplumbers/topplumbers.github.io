These treatments do work, particularly if you are dealing with a small drain clog. However, they are generally short-lived fixes that do not provide irreversible resolutions.</p>

<p>Low pH also increases the corrosiveness of water. pH is the measure of hydrogen ion activity in a service and is used to express the intensity of the level of acidity of a service.

Acids are compounds that release hydrogen ions, which oxidize the metals in pipes, accelerating deterioration Carbon dioxide will potentially add to the development of carbonic acid, thus making the water more corrosive. The existence of high levels of co2 tends to associate with specific geologic conditions.</p>
