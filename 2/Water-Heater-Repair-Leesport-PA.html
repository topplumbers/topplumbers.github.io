Because of the age of the house and location of the pipe, it was a difficult task. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to make sure the system was working prior to they left. I am truly grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>

The demand upstream might trigger a turnaround in circulation.</p>
