<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your home, which makes its plumbing's efficient functioning a necessity more than a need. Once the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair process. It is essential that the plumbing system be turned on extremely gradually to assure no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air needs to be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system must be inspected to guarantee no valves were inadvertently left open or did not close properly. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are entirely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>
