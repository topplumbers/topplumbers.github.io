Sometimes whatever is obstructing the drain will not budge. It might be time to call a professional plumber if you have actually tried to unclog a bathroom or kitchen sink with no luck. They can figure out the place of the blockage and the best methods to unclog the bottleneck without hurting your plumbing.</p>
