<p>Water temperature issues can be repaired by adjusting the temperature level on the water heater. Low water pressure from a sink faucet may be caused by a blocked aerator screen. Homeowners can just unscrew the aerator screen from the faucet to clear out minerals or other deposits. Water pressure can likewise be low if the shutoff valves under the sink are not open all the way.</p>

If this is what is occurring to your house, you need your drain cleaned up before it leads to additional damage and even costlier repairs.</p>
