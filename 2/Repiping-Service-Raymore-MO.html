<p>Viking SupplyNet's extensive stock of backflow valves and associated devices consists of leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water system react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become fragile. This leads to micro-fractures and minimizes the standard structural integrity of the system. The system ends up being weak and may fail without caution, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Improper installation is also a typical cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to spot.</p>
