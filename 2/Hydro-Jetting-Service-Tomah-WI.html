<p>Strong sewage smell in your bathroom and other locations of your house. A sewage smell originating from your bathroom or another area of your home can be an indicator of a serious issue with your plumbing. Pipes in your house may have burst or otherwise broken. It is necessary that you call a qualified plumber if there is a persistent sewage odor in your home. Raw sewage is very hazardous and can pose major health risks.</p>
<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we reveal are measured from the within bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water supply shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer lowers water service pressure to the structure; additional, more substantial costs can happen if the drop in water pressure ends up being a concern for homeowners. A PE or RA can help identify if installing a pump or bigger size water service and backflow prevention device would combat the pressure loss.</p>
<p>The average toilet will last for years and have very little problems that can be easily fixed without replacement.
