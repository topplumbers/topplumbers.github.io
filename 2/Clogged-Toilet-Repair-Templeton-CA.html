It is very important that the repair service technician understands the correct installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly.

Many backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is necessary that the assembly just be set up if it is approved for that orientation.

Oftentimes, people choose to soften only the hot water.</p>
<p>If owner selects to keep well, it should meet the existing code requirements and have a working pump and faucet. For additional info, contact the Well and Septic Division at (937) 225-4428. The well will need to be checked if owner selects to abandon the well. A license for inspection may be acquired from the Well and Septic Department at (937) 225-4428. It is recommended that you call your local water purveyor for their requirements.</p>
<p>While pipe lining is an excellent option for most people, there are some circumstances where repiping is the only option. Repiping is the procedure of changing old corroded pipes with lasting and durable brand-new pipes. The new pipes that are used are typically made of copper because of their sturdiness and other aspects. Repiping is mainly done on old pipes that were integrated in the '70s and made out of galvanized metals.</p>
