<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a couple of things you can do to keep your drains clear. Avoid putting grease or oil down the drains. Utilize an option of baking soda and vinegar regularly to keep your drains and waste disposal unit clean. You can use a natural drain cleaner regular monthly to keep your drains clear. We recommend natural products, such as Bio-Clean, due to the fact that they work much better than products containing severe chemicals and will not trigger damage to your drains or fixtures.</p>
