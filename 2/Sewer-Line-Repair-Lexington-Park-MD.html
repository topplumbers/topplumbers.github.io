<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable water supply pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
