<p>A rule of thumb is that you can recapture the cost of the repair if the problems happens well outside that 8 to 12 year lifespan. If, state, you need a brand-new burner kit and the hot water heater is five years old, then it makes good sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, particularly if you can do the work yourself. The closer the device is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more doubtful the economics of a repair becomes. The reason is that some other part on the device will go or its tank will leak. And there's no remedy for a leaking tank.</p>
<p>If you suspect your toilet has a leak, the bright side is that it doesn't always need a repair of your entire system.

When these parts wear out, they lead to tiny leaks that are difficult to see with the naked eye. This is why it is essential to call a plumber as quickly as you think you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not just does a leaking toilet waste water, it can also result in flooding and water damage.</p>
