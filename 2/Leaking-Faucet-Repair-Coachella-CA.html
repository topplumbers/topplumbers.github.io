Backflow can happen in a variety of situations that might draw water from locations such as garden water fountains, swimming pools, or lawn sprinkler systems into City water supply lines. Backflow can likewise carry water into your plumbing if it is linked to any outdoors water source. One example would be a garden hose connected to an external faucet with the end left in a mud puddle in a garden area.</p>
