You also need to think about the fuel source.</p>
<p>Filtration in sink taps and refrigerator water dispensers improves water's taste, but its steep cost makes it unwise as a household option. Packaged chemicals soften water in little batches, such as washing machine loads, however render the water undrinkable, take a toll on clothing, and, sometimes, consist of phosphates that harm the environment.
