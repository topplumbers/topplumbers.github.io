<p>Test for water tightness by plugging the drain with the stopper and filling the sink with an inch of water.

Check for leaks and tighten up as needed. Plug system into a GFCI-protected receptacle, and arrange cables as preferred.</p>
<p>3. Consider a hair-stopper: The number 1 reason our Thousand Oaks drain cleaning specialists are called into a home is since there is too much hair in the shower drain.
