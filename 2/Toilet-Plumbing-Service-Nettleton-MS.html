When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it hard for the water to travel through. The pipes frequently make weird gurgling sounds as water efforts to pass through a clogged pipe because of the tight space. This triggers the water to bubble, as only little pockets of air are accessible, resulting in the odd sounds originating from your sink.</p>
