<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Sick Of False Assures? Water distributes in the tank where tiny resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads act as a sponge, adsorbing the firmness minerals from your water. This procedure is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a process called regeneration). Throughout this procedure, the resin beads are cleaned with the highly concentrated saltwater option (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The brine requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and changed with salt or potassium ions.</p>

<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the difficult water is softened. The water supply line feeds the hard water into the tank. The water permeates through the bed of resin beads, transferring the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions.

The backflow of water brings contaminants back to the main supply of water system, making the water in it hazardous to drink.</p>
