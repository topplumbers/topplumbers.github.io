<p>Backflow implies the unfavorable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from occurring. Points at which a safe and clean water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be carefully designed and set up to avoid backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
