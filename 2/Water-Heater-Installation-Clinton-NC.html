<p>Clark's Process: This process is also called lime softening. The chemical calcium hydroxide, called limewater, is contributed to water, which causes the solidity ions to precipitate. The alkalinity of the water is raised through this addition to above 9.6, so carbon dioxide should be added to re-carbonate the water and bring the pH back down.
