<p>There are different causes for clogs depending on where they occur in your plumbing Toilets clog from too much toilet tissue for the most part. When the bathroom tissue gathers in the sewer pipe leading from the toilet rather of flowing through it, the toilet will not flush. The water only back up in the bowl. When our plumber has to remove the toilet to unclog the drain properly, there are times.</p>
<p>On average, the cost to replace a toilet varies in between $ 122 and $228, with many homeowners spending around $ 150 to $180. This does not consist of the rate of the toilet, which averages $ 99 to $199, for an overall toilet replacement cost of $ 221 to $427. A high-efficiency toilet with extra features can cost $ 800 to $1,500 to install. The average installation takes a plumber 2 to 4 hours at $ 65 per hour. If you're changing an existing toilet, include $ 30 to $50 to eliminate your old toilet.</p>
<p>When the pressure in a personal water system surpasses the pressure in the public water circulation lines that can cause regular flow to reverse, backpressure happens. A pump utilized to increase the water pressure within a structure's plumbing system to reach a greater floor might trigger this. Preventive cleaning for drains must be carried out on all drains, including toilet, floor, tub and sink drains.</p>
