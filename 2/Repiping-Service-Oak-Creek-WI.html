Throughout regeneration, salty water from the brine tank streams up the fill tube and into the softener tank. A rinse cycle commences and the salty water washes the mineral deposits off the resin beads. The regenerated water and the mineral deposits are flushed out the discharge hose. The system then reverts back to softening the incoming water.</p>

A house owner's policy might cover this kind of repair. In addition, if a rupture is produced by an utility company, it might be covered.
