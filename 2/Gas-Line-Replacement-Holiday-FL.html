<p>Wet pipe systems are installed in locations where the ambient temperature is preserved at or above 40 Â° F.

In scenarios where there is a need to offer sprinklers in an unheated area, such as a little packing dock, an antifreeze system can be used. The addition of this chemical additive will require the installation of a high risk defense assembly.</p>
