<p>The salt water tank aids the water softening system in regrowth. It is a much shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds an extremely concentrated option of salt (or often potassium) to bring back the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is manually contributed to the brine tank in the form of blocks or pellets. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capacity of the resin is reducing, the heavy brine solution is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. The water passing through the unit will no longer be softened if the salt water tank runs out of salt.</p>
