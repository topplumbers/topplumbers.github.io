<p>While combating a fire, firefighters are naturally more worried about drawing adequate water to douse the blaze than backflow prevention.

<p>Quality sinks correctly installed last for decades, so we're normally employed for kitchen and bath remodels. But with spots or scratches in a kitchen sink along with broken or split porcelain in bathroom sinks many homeowners pick a sink installation alone. Fixtures and sinks may also establish drain problems that call for a sink repair. Bathroom sink repairs also consist of changing or changing the pop-up stopper assembly.</p>
