I will definitely use Clog Dawg once again. Installing a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical per hour rate of $25 to $70. These costs are in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. The total you pay may be higher if your plumber has a minimum callout cost that is higher than the labor cost for the work.</p>
