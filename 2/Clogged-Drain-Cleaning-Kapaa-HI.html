The client assisted our service technician in moving the toilet back into its appropriate location, and the service technician tightened up the bolts prior to restoring the supply of water and ensuring that the toilet was effectively flushing.</p>
<p>No warm water-- The lack of hot water is the biggest sign that there is something incorrect with your San Antonio water heater.
