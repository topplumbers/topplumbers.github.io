<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
