<h3>What Services Do Plumbers Provide Stoughton MA</h3>
<p>To figure out if your home is a poly home," start with the exterior. Underground water mains are generally blue in color (they can also be gray or black). The pipe is normally 1/2 to 1-inch in size. Frequently, it enters the home near the water heater. Your main shut down is connected to completion of the water pipe. Make sure you check both ends of the pipe. We have actually found cases where the copper pipe gets in the house and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
<p>Was your home developed before the 1970s and has not undergone renovation or pipe replacement? If so, it is most likely that your pipes are made of galvanized metal or another product which has actually rusted and decomposed over the years. Older pipes can cause major leaks and even infect your water as they decay. Even the greatest quality pipes will not last forever and will need to be replaced.</p>
