<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high threat" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, but likewise has a 3rd check valve that is actually a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk circumstances is due to the fact that if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve provides an extra layer of protection compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you check an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
