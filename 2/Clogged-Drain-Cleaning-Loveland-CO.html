<p>In some households, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to method when looking for a practical service, specifically when basic plunging does not seem to work. However, there are many downsides to using these harmful items - not least of which is that they normally consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a clog, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of providing the threat of harm to your home and family.</p>
