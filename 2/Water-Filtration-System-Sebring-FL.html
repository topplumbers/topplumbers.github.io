<p>Natural gas is the one we are most carefully exposed to. This gas is utilized for heating our houses, for lightening our stoves, and for running devices such as hot water heater. This gas is made of a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially referred to as marsh gas or overload gas. Methane is a naturally occurring gas that happens in the earth's crust and is likewise sometimes formed by the decomposing of organic matters like sewage or manure. As useful as this gas is, the functions that make this gas hazardous is its odorless and colorless nature, that makes it a silent killer. Nevertheless, to prevent off that risk, mercaptans are included into natural gas, which gives it a rotten egg odor and makes it noticeable when leaking.
