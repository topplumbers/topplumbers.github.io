<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a few things you can do to keep your drains clear. Prevent putting grease or oil down the drains. Use a service of baking soda and vinegar regularly to keep your drains and waste disposal unit clean. You can utilize an organic drain cleaner monthly to keep your drains clear. We advise organic products, such as Bio-Clean, because they work better than items containing harsh chemicals and will not cause damage to your drains or fixtures.</p>
<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a used flapper is normally the offender. However not constantly. Initially, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing strongly if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with insufficient slack can cause problem too. Image 3 demonstrates how to set the slack perfect.</p>
<p>There's a good opportunity you have galvanized pipes if you have an older house.
