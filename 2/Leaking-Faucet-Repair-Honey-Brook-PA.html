<p>It is approximated that the average individual spends over 3 years of their life resting on the toilet, and many bathroom readers are at danger of ending up being completely connected to the fixture. Which is why choosing a comfortable, reliable toilet seat is very essential. However, you have to make sure your toilet seat in fact fits your toilet. The majority of toilets are standard sized - meaning a "will fit" seat suffices for safety and convenience. Some toilets, however, have uniquely formed bowls and require a particular seat, like the Eljer Emblem. It truly isn't a good concept to utilize a toilet seat that is either much too huge or much to little, unless they have been specifically created to fit typical toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and trigger you to slide around, or will not distribute your weight equally and might eventually cause fractures in the bowl.</p>
