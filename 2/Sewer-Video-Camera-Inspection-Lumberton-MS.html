Which is why picking a comfortable, reliable toilet seat is extremely essential. However, you need to ensure your toilet seat really fits your toilet. Most of toilets are basic sized - indicating a "will fit" seat is sufficient for security and comfort. Some toilets, nevertheless, have distinctively shaped bowls and need a specific seat, like the Eljer Emblem. It really isn't a good idea to use a toilet seat that is either much too huge or much to little, unless they have been specifically created to fit typical toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and cause you to slide around, or will not distribute your weight uniformly and might ultimately cause cracks in the bowl.</p>
