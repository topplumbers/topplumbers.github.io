For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away much more rapidly.

You might need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting properly. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. Tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled.
