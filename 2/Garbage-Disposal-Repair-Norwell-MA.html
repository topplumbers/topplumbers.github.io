<p>Echologics has a long history of developing acclaimed acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (generally from your house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be utilized to assess the type and condition of underground pipes, and to identify problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, blockages, deterioration or collapsed pipes.

<p>Pipes can last anywhere from 20 to 70 years depending upon the product. To maintain your safety, health, and home convenience, we use only the very best piping: polyethylene.
