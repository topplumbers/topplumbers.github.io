<p>All piping under sinks and faucets are checked for leaks or damage. How to inform if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and include the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we recommend having them replaced right away. Before you can request an inspection, you should initially acquire the needed authorization( s) for the work you intend to do. You can have a look at our License page to find out more on getting an authorization. Once you acquire a license you can start with the work. Nevertheless, you need to require inspection prior to you cover or conceal any work.</p>

Repiping is mostly done on old pipes that were integrated in the '70s and made out of galvanized metals.</p>
