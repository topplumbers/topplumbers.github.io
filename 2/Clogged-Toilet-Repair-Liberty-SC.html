<p>Clark's Process: This process is likewise called lime softening. The chemical calcium hydroxide, called limewater, is contributed to water, which causes the firmness ions to precipitate. The alkalinity of the water is raised through this addition to above 9.6, so co2 should be contributed to re-carbonate the water and bring the pH pull back. When it concerns pipe repair, the most costly elements aren't the machinery or materials used, but the landscaping, yard and uprooting damage that takes place.</p>

<p>In some cases, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates information on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to understand what the field test data means for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester analyzes the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
