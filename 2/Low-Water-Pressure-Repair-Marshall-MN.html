<p>These guys were remarkable! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue off and on for several years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I picked this company since they had fantastic evaluations and a fair rate, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a great task tidying up after it too.</p>
