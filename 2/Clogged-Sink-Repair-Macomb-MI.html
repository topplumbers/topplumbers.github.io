<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some parts may have really tight tolerances that need to be maintained. A crucial thing to determine on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the part. The guide is a very crucial part of the design of each component. If the component is not fixed correctly, the guide could limit the movement (instead of constant or direct) of the component, which could cause the part to not work to its capabilities.

In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the component causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>
