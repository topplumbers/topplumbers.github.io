<h2>Tips To Hire Professional Plumbing Company in Marietta</h2>

Again, the very best kind of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to ensure there is an air space, if there is no way to supply one, then we check to see that the correct BFP device is installed.
