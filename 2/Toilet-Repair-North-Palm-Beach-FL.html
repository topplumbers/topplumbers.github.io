Water pressure might be or fail lowered when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high demand on the water system (for instance, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Minimized pressure in the pipe may allow polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
