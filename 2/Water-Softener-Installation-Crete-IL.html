Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a combination of both.

<p>Inspect the washer for wear or cracks when you get rid of the cap to flush out the valve. Changing a bad washer is simple and cheap. But discovering the ideal washer might not be. The most common washers are frequently readily available in your home centers and hardware shops. Other styles can be hard to discover. If you choose to hunt for a washer, eliminate it and take it to the shop to find a match. Plumbers usually replace the whole fill valve instead of hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
