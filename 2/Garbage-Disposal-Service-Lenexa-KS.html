<p>Viking SupplyNet's extensive inventory of backflow valves and related devices consists of leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water system react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become fragile. This results in micro-fractures and minimizes the fundamental structural integrity of the system. The system ends up being weak and may fail without caution, triggering damage to the building structure and personal effects. Incorrect installation is also a common cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to find.</p>
