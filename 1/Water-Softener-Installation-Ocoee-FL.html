<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod, carefully lift the rod and listen. If the water turns off, you might be able to stop the running by adjusting the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A below). Bend the float arm if there is no modification screw. Make sure it's changed effectively (Picture 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You don't have to empty the tank to make these adjustments.</p>
