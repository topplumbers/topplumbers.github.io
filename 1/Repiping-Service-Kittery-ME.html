<p>Ron Steele Plumbing installs the highest rated and # 1 toilets for our Charlotte area clients. Toto toilets are Made in the USA and consist of features a number of our consumers enjoy. Soft-close covers and seating so there is no more slamming covers, dual-max flushing systems to prevent clogs forever, and obviously WaterSense innovation assures you a green" and high efficiency water saving toilet for your house.</p>
<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a worn flapper is typically the offender. But not constantly. First, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing strongly if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with insufficient slack can cause difficulty too. Photo 3 shows how to set the slack perfect.</p>
<p>Soap - Soap builds up down the drain because they generally include grease and fat. When the fat of the soap integrates with mineral water, it forms a solid residue and sticks to the pipes, blocking them. Call and schedule a follow up inspection by an EBMUD Backflow Inspector to validate that assembly is properly installed. The toilet is the most used plumbing fixture in your house. The frequent use of your toilet suggests that plumbing problems will need your prompt attention. We provide professional Jacksonville Toilet Repair and Replacement services, and are on call when you need us.</p>
