<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to just abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very quickly. This is the main reason we will suggest a full repipe in certain neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
