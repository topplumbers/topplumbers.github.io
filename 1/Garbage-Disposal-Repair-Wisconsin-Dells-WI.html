Wipe with a soft fabric and then more Coke, over and over, etc. Then use Naval Jelly which includes a lot more phosphoric acid (be sure to check out the instructions and safety cautions initially!), if that does not do the technique. Naval Jelly is what we here at ® use to eliminate rust stains and it's readily available at a lot of hardware stores.</p>

From a health viewpoint, these minerals have no adverse results and are, in fact, essential day-to-day nutrients. It is minerals that offer water the rejuvenating flavor lots of people find preferable. However, when calcium and magnesium penetrate water, they buildup on contact surfaces, perhaps plug pipes and damage water heaters, and decrease the efficiency of soaps and detergents. At this moment the water is said to be difficult.</p>
