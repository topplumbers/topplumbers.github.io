Wipe with a soft fabric and then more Coke, over and over, etc. Then use Naval Jelly which includes a lot more phosphoric acid (be sure to check out the instructions and safety cautions initially!), if that does not do the technique. Naval Jelly is what we here at Â® use to eliminate rust stains and it's readily available at a lot of hardware stores.</p>
