<h3>How to Clear Clogged Drains Without Calling a Plumber in Crown Point IN 46307</h3>
<p>Water temperature issues can be fixed by adjusting the temperature on the water heater. Low water pressure from a sink faucet might be triggered by a blocked aerator screen. House owners can simply unscrew the aerator screen from the faucet to clear out minerals or other deposits. If the shutoff valves under the sink are not open all the way, water pressure can also be low.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another technique is to present a chemical compound that functions as a chelating representative. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating representative and stay suspended in the water rather than building up on surfaces. However, if they remain in one place for long, as they may in a hot water heater, the buildup could still happen.</p>
