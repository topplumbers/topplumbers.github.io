<h3>How Often Should Plumbing Check Bay City TX</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation needs the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed signed up designer (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you identify if your building requires a backflow preventer or several devices, or if you qualify for an exemption. Exemptions, which are approved in very unusual cases where the building is deemed to not position a risk to the water system, should be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, however the DEP has no record of its installation, you must have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, along with an initial test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
