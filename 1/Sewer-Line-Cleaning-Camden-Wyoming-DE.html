<p>Another common argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves should prevent backflow.  The obvious problem with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard by hand operated valve should stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless the majority of the automated valves, such as the electric solenoid valves utilized for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and completely closed.</p>

<p>Inspect the washer for wear or cracks when you eliminate the cap to flush out the valve. Replacing a bad washer is easy and cheap. But finding the right washer might not be. The most common washers are often readily available at home centers and hardware stores. Other designs can be tough to find. If you decide to hunt for a washer, remove it and take it to the store to discover a match. Plumbers usually replace the entire fill valve instead of hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
<p>I can't say enough good ideas about this company. Had a sewer repair needed and had a really short amount of time due to closing on a home sale.
