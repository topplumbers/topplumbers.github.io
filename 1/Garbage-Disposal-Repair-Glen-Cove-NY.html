<h3>Plumbing And Water Heater Repair Glen Cove NY</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered designer (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you identify if your structure needs a backflow preventer or multiple devices, or if you qualify for an exemption. Exemptions, which are given in extremely rare cases where the structure is considered to not pose a threat to the supply of water, should be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, however the DEP has no record of its installation, you must have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, in addition to a preliminary test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
<p>Soft water is readily available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, even during regrowth. Running toilets can be the result of a rusty overflow pipe, worn flush valve assembly, or broken flapper valve.
