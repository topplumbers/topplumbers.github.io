<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Echologics has a long history of developing acclaimed acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (normally from your house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be utilized to examine the type and condition of underground pipes, and to determine problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, blockages, rust or collapsed pipes. Homeowners might have a video inspection done to discover the cause of regular sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when selling or buying an older house.</p>
<p>Your storm drains do not go directly into the ground and into oblivion either, this water is usually directed in other places to a nearby treatment plant, a creek, or perhaps the ocean in.
