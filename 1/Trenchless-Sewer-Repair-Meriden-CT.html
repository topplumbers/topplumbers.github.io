It has two spring checks, however also has a third check valve that is in fact a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure).

It was set up 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I chose this company due to the fact that they had terrific evaluations and a reasonable rate, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a great job tidying up after it also.</p>
