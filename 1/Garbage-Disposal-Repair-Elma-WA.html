Sediment Build-Up: If you discover weird popping, banging, or clanging sounds coming from your system, this might be an indication that sediment has actually built up in your tank, and is triggering a reaction with the heating component. Running out of warm water quickly is another sign of sediment build-up, since the sediment is taking up more space in the tank, so your water therefore takes longer to heat. To fix this issue, you will likely need to eliminate the tank.</p>
