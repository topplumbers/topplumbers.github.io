Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water supply react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and end up being fragile. This results in micro-fractures and minimizes the basic structural stability of the system. The system ends up being weak and might fail without caution, triggering damage to the building structure and personal effects. Inappropriate installation is also a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to detect.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming potable water system. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
