<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely pleased with their service.</p>
