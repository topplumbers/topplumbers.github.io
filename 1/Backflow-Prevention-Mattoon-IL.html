<p>Organic particles, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's drain, cable television or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a novice's DIY project. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
