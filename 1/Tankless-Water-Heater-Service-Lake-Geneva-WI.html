<h3>Leaky Faucets in Lake Geneva WI 53147 - Renewing Valve Seats and Sealing Stems</h3>
<p>Aside from these 2 important components, there are a myriad of little, perhaps less crucial things that can deteriorate or break. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust far more rapidly. Consistent gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting correctly, you may need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. Tank lids can break and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by pointing out all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to work at its best.</p>
<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you believe a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, try this: squirt a few drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After 30 minutes, examine to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has altered color. If it has, you more than likely have a leak.</p>
<p>On average, the cost to replace a toilet varies between $ 122 and $228, with most house owners investing around $ 150 to $180. This does not consist of the cost of the toilet, which averages $ 99 to $199, for a total toilet replacement cost of $ 221 to $427. A high-efficiency toilet with additional features can cost $ 800 to $1,500 to install. The typical installation takes a plumber 2 to 4 hours at $ 65 per hour. If you're replacing an existing toilet, add $ 30 to $50 to remove your old toilet.</p>
