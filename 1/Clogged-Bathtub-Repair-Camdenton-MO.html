Some homeowners will attempt to dislodge the clog using store-bought drain cleaners and natural natural home remedy, like vinegar or lemon juice with baking soda. These remedies do work, particularly if you are dealing with a little drain clog. However, they are generally short-lived repairs that do not provide permanent resolutions.</p>
