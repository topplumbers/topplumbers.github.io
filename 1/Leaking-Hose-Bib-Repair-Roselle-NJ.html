Merely put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. You can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that doesn't work.

If utilizing one of these products, please make sure to take the suitable preventative measures.</p>
