Inspecting the water meter is a great next step in your plumbing inspection. If the water meter is turning, close all faucets and inspect. There is a leak somewhere and this could be major issue if it is. Move on to the valves. Start with the main shut down valve operation. When shut off, no faucet in the house should have water. This goes for every other shut down valve and their matching faucets. If everything is working appropriately, you are off to an excellent start.</p>
