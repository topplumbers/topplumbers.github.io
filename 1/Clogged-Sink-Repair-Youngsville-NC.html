<p>Pipeline video inspection is a type of telepresence used to aesthetically inspect the interiors of pipelines, plumbing systems, and storm drains A common application is for a plumber to determine the condition of little size sewer lines and household connection drain pipes.

<p>A guideline is that you can recapture the cost of the repair if the problems takes place well outside that 8 to 12 year lifespan. If, say, you need a new burner kit and the water heater is 5 years old, then it makes good sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, particularly if you can do the work yourself. The closer the device is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more skeptical the economics of a repair ends up being. The factor is that some other part on the device will go or its tank will leak. And there's no remedy for a leaking tank.</p>
