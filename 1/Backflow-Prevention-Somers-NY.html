The membrane has pores large enough to admit water molecules for passage; hardness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft water system is without solidity ions without any other ions being included. Membranes are a kind of water filter needing regular cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
