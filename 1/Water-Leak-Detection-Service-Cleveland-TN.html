<p>To figure out if your house is a poly house," start with the outside. Underground water mains are typically blue in color (they can likewise be black or gray). The pipe is normally 1/2 to 1-inch in diameter. Regularly, it gets in the house near the water heater. Your main shut down is connected to the end of the water main. Make sure you check both ends of the pipe. We have actually found cases where the copper pipe gets in the house and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
