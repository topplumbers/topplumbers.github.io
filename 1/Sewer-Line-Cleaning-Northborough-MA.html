TLC's drain specialists are certified and experienced in carrying out drain and sewer line inspections for homes.

We will help you prevent the risks of inaccurate sink installation, making sure that your brand-new sink fits in the area you have, all pipes are practical, caulking is tight, and the sink looks and works great.</p>
<p>Garbage disposal systems may cost more when they have to fit local water and sewer capabilities. The plumbing in the house should work well or backup can occur, and septic systems might need to be updated to deal with the disposal. Baffles: Baffles prevent flatware from entering the garbage disposal, so you're just sending out food and compostable waste down the drain.</p>
