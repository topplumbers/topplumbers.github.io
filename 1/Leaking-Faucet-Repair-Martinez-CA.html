<p>A total repipe of a house's water system, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most expensive and elaborate plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on entire house repiping. Recent Review: Carlos and Lopez were fantastic. My 90 years of age Father's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos got to 8am the next day to repair. It was a hard job due to the fact that of the age of the house and place of the pipe. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to make sure the system was working prior to they left. I am truly grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>
