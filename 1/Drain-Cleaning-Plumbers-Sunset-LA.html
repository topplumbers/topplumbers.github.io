<p>As a locally-owned company, integrity and duty are incredibly essential to building a credibility for quality. Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Area 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses security of the potable water system within a building these devices are known as seclusion" BFP. Again, the best type of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to make sure there is an air space, if there is no chance to offer one, then we check to see that the appropriate BFP device is installed. These BFP's, if testable, are needed to be evaluated (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months afterwards.</p>
<p>Water firmness is the quantity of liquified calcium and magnesium in the water-- tough water is high in both calcium and magnesium.
