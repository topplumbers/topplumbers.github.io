<p>The salt water tank aids the water softening system in regeneration. It is a shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds an extremely concentrated option of salt (or often potassium) to restore the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is manually added to the salt water tank in the kind of blocks or pellets. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve signs up the softening capacity of the resin is decreasing, the heavy salt water option is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.

<p>The best source for this kind of plumber is a general contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's covered up; you don't get that chance.
