<h3>Most Common Plumbing Emergencies Sarver PA</h3>
<p>The most reliable way to address difficult water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When hard water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>The most typical method for producing soft water is through ion exchange, a process in which the calcium and magnesium in the water are exchanged for another element, typically salt. Sodium won't cause lime scale or soap scum buildup like other minerals do, and water softening adds just an extremely small amount of sodium to your water. According to the Mayo Center, an 8-ounce glass of soft water would have less than 12.5 milligrams of salt, which is considered very low sodium" by the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
