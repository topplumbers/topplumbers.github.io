<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some components may have really tight tolerances that need to be kept. An important thing to determine on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the component. The guide is an extremely crucial part of the design of each component. If the part is not fixed effectively, the guide might limit the movement (instead of direct or consistent) of the part, which could cause the element to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are restricting the travel of the component causing lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
