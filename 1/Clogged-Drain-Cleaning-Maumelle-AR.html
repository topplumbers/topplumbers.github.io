<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania currently has no licensure or accreditation requirements for most construction contractors (or their employees). The secret to the innovation is being able to control both the crystal development rate and their elimination from our polymer beads, thus removing firmness ions and producing a water softening advantage that does not need replacement chemicals or regeneration of active sites," mentioned Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and primary technology officer. This innovation is more cost effective and lasts longer than typical water softening products such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
<p>Each part of the assembly must be tested to identify what needs repair. The field test might not always show you the seriousness of the failure or whether repair parts beyond the fundamental rubber repair kit are required. There may be extra test procedures, beyond those established in the tester certification program, that can supply data revealing the severity of the failure that might assist in the diagnostic analysis of the backflow prevention assembly.</p>
