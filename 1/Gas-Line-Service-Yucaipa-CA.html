<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your home, that makes its plumbing's effective working a requirement more than a need. Once the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated throughout the repair procedure. It is important that the plumbing system be switched on extremely slowly to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air should be removed from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system should be examined to ensure no valves were inadvertently left open or did not close correctly. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are completely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>
