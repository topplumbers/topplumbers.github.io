<p>Brine Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Features automated shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or gas is really low. Rainwater which has actually not infiltrated the earth is an incredibly pure form of water. When water vaporizes it leaves behind dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when evaporated water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>Fire department connections can be an issue when used in combating a fire. Firefighters by and big are not concerned with backflow prevention concerns. They are interesting in protecting people's lives and to a lesser level their residential or commercial property.
