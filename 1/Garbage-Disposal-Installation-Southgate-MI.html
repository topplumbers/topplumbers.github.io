<h3>Hose Bib Replacement in Southgate Michigan</h2>
<p>Water softening makes use of a procedure called "ion exchange" to eliminate liquified difficult water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron and manganese. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the hard water flows through the resin, the salt is switched for the tough water minerals. The hard water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace amount of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
