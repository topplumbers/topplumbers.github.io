This results in micro-fractures and reduces the fundamental structural stability of the system. The system becomes weak and may stop working without warning, triggering damage to the building structure and personal effects. Incorrect installation is likewise a typical cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly difficult to detect.</p>
