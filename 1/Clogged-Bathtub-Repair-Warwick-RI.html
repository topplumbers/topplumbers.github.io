<p>A total repipe of a house's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most pricey and intricate plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in entire home repiping. Current Review: Carlos and Lopez were amazing. My 90 years of age Dad's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos reached 8am the next day to repair. It was a difficult job because of the age of the house and location of the pipe. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to make certain the system was working before they left. I am genuinely grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>
