<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to just abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason we will recommend a full repipe in certain areas, based on our experience.</p>
