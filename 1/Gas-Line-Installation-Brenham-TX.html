<p>Whether replacing an old one or putting one in for the very first time, there are a couple of things worth knowing about garbage disposal installation.

Another idea to stop blocking is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for several seconds after you are ended up cleaning to make sure the drain is clear.</p>
