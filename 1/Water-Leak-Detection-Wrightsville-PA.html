<p>Often caused by sluggish seepage from the tank into the bowl. Put a few drops of food coloring in the tank. Wait an hour, then see and inspect if you see coloring in the bowl.

<p>Your waste disposal unit ensures that your sink and plumbing components don't get clogged. Contrary to some people's perception, garbage disposals do not include blades.

This high-speed action effectively crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without clogging.</p>
