<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Stockbridge GA</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered designer (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you identify if your building requires a backflow preventer or multiple devices, or if you qualify for an exemption. Exemptions, which are approved in very rare cases where the structure is deemed to not posture a threat to the supply of water, need to be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, however the DEP has no record of its installation, you must have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, in addition to an initial test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
