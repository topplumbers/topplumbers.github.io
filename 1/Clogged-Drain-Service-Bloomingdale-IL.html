<p>Water softening makes use of a procedure called "ion exchange" to eliminate liquified hard water minerals such as calcium, iron, manganese and magnesium. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the difficult water flows through the resin, the salt is swapped for the hard water minerals. The hard water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace amount of salt drains with the softened water.</p>
<p>The next criteria to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is essential that the repair technician understands the proper installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be set up in the installation orientation for which it was approved. The majority of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is very important that the assembly just be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work effectively and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
