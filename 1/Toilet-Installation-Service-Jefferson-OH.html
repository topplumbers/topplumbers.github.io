<h3>Quality Plumbing Service Jefferson OH</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
