<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to only desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason why we will advise a complete repipe in specific areas, based upon our experience.</p>
