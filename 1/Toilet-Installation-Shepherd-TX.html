<p>Set out the new disposal and parts in preparation for installation. I've been to many carwashes that have a softener, and to the surprise of the owners, the water tests hard even after having gone through the softener.

<p>Wet pipe systems are installed in areas where the ambient temperature level is preserved at or above 40 Â° F. When a sprinkler is activated by heat from a fire, water streams right away from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times.
