<p>A total repipe of a home's water system, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most costly and elaborate plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in entire house repiping. For an outdoor gas light or home appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger a blockage or can cause rust that obstructs the line. Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a gas line. Noise-- Over time sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment ultimately gets hard and removes from the capacity of your water heater. This hardened sediment is most likely the source of the sound.</p>

<p>In some cases, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to understand what the field test information suggests for that particular assembly.  When a skilled tester analyzes the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
