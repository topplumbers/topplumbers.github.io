<p>The most efficient method to deal with difficult water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When tough water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>

A clogged kitchen sink is generally a sign of a clog in the plumbing system. If the blockage isn't gotten rid of, water pressure can build up within the pipe, eventually triggering it to burst.</p>
