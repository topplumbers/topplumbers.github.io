<p>When the potable supply piping is connected to a system or fixture which goes beyond the operating pressure of the supply piping, backpressure might occur. Greater pressure can be caused by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or elevated piping in places such as high-rise buildings or tanks. Potable and non-potable water or liquids can be forced into the safe and clean supply system if these connections are not effectively safeguarded.</p>
<p>Colored water-- If your hot water seems rusty, this could be an indicator that your water heater is rusting on the inside and might begin leaking quickly. You can check on this by filling a couple of five-gallon buckets with your water. Compare If your cold water is clear and your hot water is a brownish color, you most likely need a water heater replacement.</p>
<p>Buying a home is a huge financial investment.
