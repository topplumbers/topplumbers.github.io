<p>A constantly running toilet suggests your house is wasting water and you're paying greater energy bills than essential.

<p>When a gas line is burst, it instantly ends up being a severe safety risk. Without being fixed as rapidly as possible, it might trigger quite a bit of damage if the gas inside becomes ignited.

<p>Remodeling plumbers normally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Once again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. However a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest much more. With this method, you know the turnkey price going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
