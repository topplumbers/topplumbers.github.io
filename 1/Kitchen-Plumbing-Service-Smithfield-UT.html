<p>Reverse osmosis utilizes an applied pressure gradient throughout a semi permeable membrane to conquer osmotic pressure and remove water molecules from the service with hardness ions. The membrane has pores large enough to admit water particles for passage; hardness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft water supply is free of hardness ions with no other ions being included. Membranes are a kind of water filter needing regular cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
