<p>Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather affordable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>
