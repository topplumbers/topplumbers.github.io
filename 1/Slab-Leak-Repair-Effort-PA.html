<p>There's an excellent opportunity you have galvanized pipes if you have an older home. And if your house was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing completion of their lifespan. As galvanized pipes age, they start to corrode. This corrosion can result in a buildup of lead, which can have many unfavorable effects on your health. Rusty pipes likewise result in poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>Clear the trap: If the above techniques do not work, the next action would be to get rid of the P-trap under the sink. Place a container underneath the area to capture water then unscrew the 2 threaded caps that hold the curved section of the pipe in location. Nowadays, a lot of kitchen drains are made of white PVC pipe with connections that can be unscrewed by hand.</p>
