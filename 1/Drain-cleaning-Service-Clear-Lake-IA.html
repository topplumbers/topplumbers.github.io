<p>Loose flanges are normally the result of wood rot. The flange screws just won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best service depends on the degree of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
<p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency, cross-connections can be a major public health danger if they do not have appropriate backflow prevention assemblies installed. There are numerous, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have been accountable for contamination of drinking water that, when taken in, triggered the spread of illness or disease.</p>
