<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the hard water is softened. The supply of water line feeds the difficult water into the tank. The water leaks through the bed of resin beads, transferring the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and flows through your pipes and out to your household home appliances. Backflow is a term utilized in the plumbing world to describe an unfavorable flow of water in the reverse direction. The backflow of water carries impurities back to the main water supply system, making the water in it unsafe to drink.</p>
