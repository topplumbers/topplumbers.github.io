<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey stated that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are quite popular with property owners in the area. He noted that there are particular pollutants that residents are handling and an RO can help minimize those concerns. Due to being mainly agricultural in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some property owners are setting up ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are an item of agricultural waste. Rinckey kept in mind that these systems remove around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic also naturally takes place in some soils which too can be remedied with the ideal RO system.</p>
