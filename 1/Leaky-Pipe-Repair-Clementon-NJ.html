<p>Loose flanges are normally the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best option depends upon the degree of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this sort of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
<p>In terms of the devices that will be examined, there are two possible choices: a minimized pressure principle device or check valves. Both consist of a mechanical backflow preventer - basically, a physical barrier to the backflow. They were wonderful at repairing the clogged drain, but really extremely sloppy about repairing the chip in the sink and the use of puddy under the sink.</p>
