<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Sick Of False Promises? Water circulates in the tank where tiny resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads act as a sponge, adsorbing the firmness minerals from your water. This process is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a procedure called regrowth). Throughout this procedure, the resin beads are washed with the highly concentrated saltwater solution (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank).
