<p>It can take several weeks for backflow preventer installation and compliance to be finished. Initially, plans for each device to be installed need to be prepared by a RA or PE, and an application for approval sent out to the DEP, which might use up to 3 weeks or more to process and authorize. Rejected plans should be modified and resubmitted to the DEP approval queue, which can add another several weeks to the timeline.</p>
