<p>The purpose of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to make sure that all plumbing installed throughout building of a new or renovated structure is installed by well-informed artisans in accordance with appropriate codes. Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you wash your hands, clean the dishes, or pour flat soda in your sink, you normally understand your drain is clogged and requires cleaning.

Another tip to stop blocking is to watch out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for several seconds after you are completed cleaning to make sure the drain is clear.</p>
