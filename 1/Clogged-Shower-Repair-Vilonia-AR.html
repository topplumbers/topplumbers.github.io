<p>Frequently brought on by sluggish seepage from the tank into the bowl. Put a few drops of food coloring in the tank. Wait an hour, then examine and see if you see coloring in the bowl. This suggests a leaky flapper valve. Replacement is normally the fix. Additionally, in some cases a faulty fill valve may actuate periodically, too. Water won't drain or is draining gradually through the disposal.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates information on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to understand what the field test data suggests for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester translates the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
