<p>Leaking gas can cause asphyxiation and unsafe surges. Luckily, commercial gasses, such as the kind a gas stove or heater uses, have a strong odor added to them so that leaks can be more quickly detected by house owners.

<p>Home water softeners, likewise called ion exchange units, are home appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. As soon as the resin beads become filled with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution gets rid of the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After going through the beads, the resulting chloride solution becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
