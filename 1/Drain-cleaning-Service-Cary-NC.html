<p>Clearly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange site. When all the sodium exchange sites are changed with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. Once backwashing is complete, the softener can be gone back to utilize. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems normally are set up in areas where the possibility of a severe fire condition is likely, such as aircraft garages. Water to the system is kept back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>

<p>It generally represents rust and mineral accumulation if you observe low water pressure or blemished water.
