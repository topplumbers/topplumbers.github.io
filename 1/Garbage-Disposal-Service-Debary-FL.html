<p>These men were fantastic! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem on and off for several years now. It was installed 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I picked this company since they had fantastic reviews and a reasonable cost, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent job cleaning up after it also.</p>
