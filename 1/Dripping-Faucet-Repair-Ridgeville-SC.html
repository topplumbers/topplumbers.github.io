<p>Replacing your sink is a step-by-step procedure. Procedure, cut, and link the pipes. Prior to attaching any pipes to your water softener, step and cut your pipes to fit. Solder on any nipples and fittings before linking the system to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic if you are utilizing copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be used. Though it might need extra adapters, versatile tubing is far much easier to deal with and can use push-to-connect fittings, conserving you time and the trouble of soldering.</p>
