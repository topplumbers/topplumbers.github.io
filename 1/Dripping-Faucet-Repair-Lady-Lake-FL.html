<p>Backflow is bad news. The harsh water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are difficult on water pipes. Over a time period the inside lining of the pipe will degrade and a little pinhole leak will develop.

<p>Your home's drainage works by the easy force of gravity. When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not actually the flow of water pushing them down your pipes. Instead, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. Anything you pour down there will not go through when something blocks the pipes.</p>
