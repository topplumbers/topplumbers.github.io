With toilets, the pro will check water levels, flappers, and filler mechanisms. She or he will eyeball noticeable pipes, and might run a camera inspection to examine the pipes' condition from the inside.</p>
<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>

Having plumbing pipes that have rust or corrosion can become a health threat in your water.</p>
