The installers start by positioning a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and attracting a brand-new seamless pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic product that will be impervious to root intrusion for as much as 100 years.</p>
