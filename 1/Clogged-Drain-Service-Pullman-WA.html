<p>Your kitchen sink is an important part of your house, that makes its plumbing's effective working a requirement more than a need. As soon as the test results reveal the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair process. It is necessary that the plumbing system be switched on very gradually to assure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air needs to be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system must be checked to guarantee no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close correctly when re-pressurized.
