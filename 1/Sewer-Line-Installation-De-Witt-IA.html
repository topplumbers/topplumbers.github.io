<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of two categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will restore on a fixed schedule and after that go back to service. Due to the fact that they restore whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for homes that are on regular water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt. Demand-control designs, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, usually restore after many gallons of water have been softened. Such designs are practical if you have a changing water use schedule.</p>
