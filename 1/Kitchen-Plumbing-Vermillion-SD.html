<p>With tankless electrical heaters, water is heated up straight whenever it's required. Tankless systems particularly use a component that warms up water when the tap is turned on. The water is constantly heated up as long as the tap stays on. The water stops being heated if the tap is immediately switched off.

<p>When the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound safe and clean water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure.
