<p>Deluge systems are created so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems usually are set up in locations where the possibility of a serious fire condition is likely, such as airplane hangars. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then allows water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
