<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the homes in our area were developed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for hot and cold water ended up being basic.

In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and produces a waterproof membrane to safeguard the iron from rusting.</p>

Look for leakages and tighten up as required. Plug system into a GFCI-protected receptacle, and organize cables as desired.</p>
