<p>How to install or replace a garbage disposal. Sewer lines can stop working for a variety of factors, including bad soil conditions, clogs from grease and grime, and corrosion. Even bushes and trees can trigger problems for sewer lines, particularly in older neighborhoods where clay pipe might have been utilized. In the cold Colorado winters, pipes can break from frozen ground, which can be two times as compounded if pipes have actually been allowed to freeze.</p>
