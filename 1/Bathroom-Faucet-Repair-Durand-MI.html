<p>These guys were fantastic! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue on and off for several years now. It was set up 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I picked this company since they had fantastic reviews and a fair cost, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts.
