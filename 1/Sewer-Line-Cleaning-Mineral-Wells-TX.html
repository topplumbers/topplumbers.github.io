<p>As the water treatment industry has actually grown in the U.S., the concept of water softening has actually often been misconstrued as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning procedure. This is due largely to overstated advertising and, in part, to consumer mistaken beliefs about water treatment. However the reality is that water softening merely eliminates hardness minerals and gets rid of problems that are a problem and not a danger to human health. The choice "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of individual choice not necessity. However, water softening does have advantages, and disadvantages, that make this choice a significant one.</p>
