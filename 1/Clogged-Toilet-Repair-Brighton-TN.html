As soon as linked at the sink drain, the dishwasher port is connected. The last thing is to wire up the brand-new disposal, making sure to connect wires accurately, and the base covered to secure the wiring from any water getting in.</p>
<p>Though it's not always needed, in some cases the plumber might need to update or repair wiring to power the brand-new waste disposal unit. This typically costs an extra $50 to $100+.
