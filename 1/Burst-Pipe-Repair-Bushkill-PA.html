<p>Home water softeners, likewise called ion exchange systems, are devices that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. As soon as the resin beads become loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution eliminates the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After going through the beads, the resulting chloride service ends up being a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>

<p>To identify if your home is a poly house," start with the outside. Underground water mains are normally blue in color (they can also be black or gray). The pipe is generally 1/2 to 1-inch in diameter. Regularly, it goes into the house near the water heater. Your main shut down is attached to completion of the water main. Ensure you check both ends of the pipe. We have discovered cases where the copper pipe goes into the home and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
