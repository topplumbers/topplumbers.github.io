<p>Water firmness is the amount of dissolved calcium and magnesium in the water-- tough water is high in both calcium and magnesium.

And that's where the term hardness" came from ... it's difficult to clean in.</p>

<p>Your home's drainage works by the easy force of gravity. When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not truly the flow of water pushing them down your pipes. Rather, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. Anything you put down there will not go through when something obstructs the pipes.</p>
