<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Fed Up With False Promises? Water flows in the tank where small resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads act as a sponge, adsorbing the hardness minerals from your water. This process is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a procedure called regeneration). During this process, the resin beads are washed with the highly focused saltwater service (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The salt water forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and changed with sodium or potassium ions.</p>

It needed to be hauled by a truck and featured a 10 hp gasoline engine and 1000 feet of steel cable. It was capable of cleaning large industrial and municipal sewer pipes. An enhanced variation called "The Mainliner" was introduced in 1958 that could likewise thread telephone cable. It was discontinued in 1973.</p>
