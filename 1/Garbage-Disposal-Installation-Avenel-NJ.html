Current Review: Carlos and Lopez were amazing. My 90 year old Daddy's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos reached 8am the next day to repair. Since of the age of the house and area of the pipe, it was a difficult job. They worked for nearly 12 hours into darkness to ensure the system was working prior to they left. I am truly grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>
<p>Do not put whatever down your garbage disposal. It's important to view what you put down your garbage disposal. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when mixed with water, and potentially trigger a clog. Fruit and vegetable peels can also cause obstructions and jams - consider composting or positioning these products in the garbage. Furthermore, grease and oil can congeal and collect in your drain also. After completing cooking, think about putting remaining grease or oil into a jar or bowl to reserve. You can then use and reheat for other cooking or easily place in the garbage after it's solidified.</p>

<p>Wet pipe systems are set up in areas where the ambient temperature is preserved at or above 40 ° F. When a sprinkler is activated by heat from a fire, water streams right away from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times. In situations where there is a need to supply sprinklers in an unheated area, such as a small loading dock, an antifreeze system can be utilized.
