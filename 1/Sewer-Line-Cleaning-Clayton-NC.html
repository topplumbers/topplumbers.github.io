<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to just desert the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future.

<p>Deluge systems are created so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems normally are installed in areas where the possibility of a serious fire condition is likely, such as aircraft hangars. Water to the system is kept back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
