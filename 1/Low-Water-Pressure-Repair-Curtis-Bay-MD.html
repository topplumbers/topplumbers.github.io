Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure happen whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
