<p>Gently listen and lift the rod if your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod. You may be able to stop the running by adjusting the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float adjustment screw on top (see Figure A listed below). Flex the float arm if there is no adjustment screw. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make sure it's adjusted appropriately (Image 8). You don't need to empty the tank to make these adjustments.</p>
<p>Your garbage disposal ensures that your sink and plumbing components do not get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's perception, garbage disposals do not contain blades. Rather, a garbage disposal features two fixed bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts force food and debris to grind against a stationary grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action successfully pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without clogging.</p>
