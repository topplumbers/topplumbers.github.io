<p>Replacing the old disposal with a similar new one is less complex than replacing with a various model. So, if you are not looking particularly for a various disposal this may be something to consider. A totally different disposal, or for installing your very first disposal, the sink adapter has to be puttied into place. A protected seal is a must. As soon as connected at the sink drain, the dishwasher connector is attached. The last thing is to wire up the new disposal, taking care to connect wires precisely, and the base covered to protect the electrical wiring from any water getting in.</p>
<p>Do not use ground joint unions except straight at the meter or after the shutoff valve at the appliance. Each location where you will have a gas appliance should have a gas shutoff valve. Within the City of Seattle only, any person who sets up gas piping on property not under their ownership need to have a Seattle Gas Piping Mechanic License. All gas piping setups need an authorization and inspection.</p>
