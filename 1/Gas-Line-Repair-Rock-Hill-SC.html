<p>An overall repipe of a home's water system, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most complex and costly plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in whole home repiping. For an outdoor gas light or device whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can cause a clog or can trigger rust that obstructs the line. Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a gas line. Noise-- Gradually sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets difficult and removes from the capacity of your water heater. This hardened sediment is likely the source of the sound.</p>
