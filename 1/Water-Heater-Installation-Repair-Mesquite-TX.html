<p>Deluge systems are created so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems normally are set up in locations where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as aircraft hangars.

If a fire occurs, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then permits water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
