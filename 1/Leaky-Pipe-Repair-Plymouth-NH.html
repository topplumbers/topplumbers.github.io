<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
<p>All of these problems are common and simple to handle when dealt with early.
