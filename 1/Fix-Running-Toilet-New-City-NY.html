Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on.
