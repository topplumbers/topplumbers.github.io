<p>Weird Sounds - If unusual gurgling is originating from your drain, it probably requires a comprehensive cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it challenging for the water to go through. Since of the tight area, the pipes often make unusual gurgling sounds as water attempts to travel through a clogged pipe.

Intrusive tree roots can cause major plumbing problems, particularly in older communities with clay sewer lines.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are usually the result of wood rot. The flange screws just will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends upon the level of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this kind of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
