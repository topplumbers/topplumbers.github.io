In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to only abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future.

<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high danger" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but likewise has a third check valve that is actually a vent available to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk situations is since if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve uses an additional layer of security compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you evaluate an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
