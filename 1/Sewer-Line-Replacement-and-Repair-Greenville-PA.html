Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Area 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses protection of the safe and clean supply of water within a structure these gadgets are referred to as seclusion" BFP. Once again, the best kind of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to make sure there is an air space, if there is no way to provide one, then we check to see that the appropriate BFP device is installed. These BFP's, if testable, are needed to be tested (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months afterwards.</p>
<p>Backflow prevention assemblies are designed to provide decades of security. There are lots of regional conditions that can shorten the working life of a backflow preventer.  Conditions such as excessive pressure, water quality, temperature level or turbidity can all trigger the assembly to degrade in its performance. Some backflow prevention assemblies may hardly ever need repair while some are repaired regularly. The test data from the field test will determine the repair frequency.</p>
