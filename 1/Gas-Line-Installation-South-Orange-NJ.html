<h3>Clogged Toilet Repair  in South Orange New Jersey</h2>
<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer kit will be attached to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws originally meant for the disposer discharge elbow. If your kit just consists of a waste arm, it is possible - though not recommended - to link this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint. The successive 90 Â° turns in such a setup can lead to improper drainage. Depending on the length of the waste arm, you might be able to cut off its elbow and utilize the remainder as a straight discharge tube.</p>
