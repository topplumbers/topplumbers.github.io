The repair may be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates information on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to know what the field test data means for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester interprets the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
