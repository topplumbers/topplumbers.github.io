<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
<p>Often a clog can be triggered due to buildup and grease within the system. Snaking the drain won't fix the concern if this is the case. You might need to look into utilizing a high pressure water supply to get rid of the clog. This procedure is a bit more costly and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending upon the severity of the clog. There are 2 standard piping products used by plumbing experts.
