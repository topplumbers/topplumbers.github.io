<p>A video camera inspection takes the uncertainty out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it prevents the need to dig up your backyard. During a video camera inspection, a sewer and drain specialist runs a video cable television down sewer branch lines that lead from bathtubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Utilizing the images captured by the camera, we can determine any sewer and drain line problems, such as blockages, tree root invasion, misaligned joints, cracks, and other damage.</p>
<p>A clogged drain can make any of your plumbing components inoperable. Whether you have a sink that does not drain properly or a shower that holds water for too long, a Sears Handyman can help. In some cases drain repair needs can be resolved fairly rapidly by a knowledgeable handyman. At other times, however, parts of a drain may need to be disassembled, taken a look at, and cleared before being replaced. Sometimes, a handyman might identify that a replacement part is necessary (like a reducer, pvc, or tailpiece  trap) to guarantee typical operation for your drain.
