<h3>How Preemptive Drain Cleaning Can Benefit A Homeowner in Mc Kee KY 40447</h3>
<p>Backflow indicates the unfavorable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a drinkable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they need to be carefully developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
