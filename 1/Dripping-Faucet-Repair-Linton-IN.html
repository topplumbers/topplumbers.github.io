<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of 2 classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a fixed schedule and after that go back to service. Since they regenerate whether the resin requires it or not, these work well for homes that are on routine water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt. Demand-control designs, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, usually regrow after so many gallons of water have actually been softened. If you have a changing water use schedule, such models are convenient.</p>
