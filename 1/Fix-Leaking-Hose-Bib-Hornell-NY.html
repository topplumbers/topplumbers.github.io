<p>Spotty meals? All Garbage Disposals are not equivalent. We've worked with practically every kind on the marketplace today. We know that the type you choose depends on your space, your cooking practices, your drain lines and your budget. Before you choose a brand-new disposal, provide us a call.

<p>Keep in mind that a disposal is not like the many basic home improvement projects around your house.

These are not simply going to trigger the disposal not to work effectively but are hazardous.</p>
