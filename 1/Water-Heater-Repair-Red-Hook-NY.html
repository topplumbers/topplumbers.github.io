Food follows the grease down the plumbing, attaching to the walls as well. Even tree roots can create severe drain obstructions by wrapping around pipes. Their crushing strength stops the water circulation, forcing plumbers to find and repair the issue for normal home plumbing operations. If this is what is happening to your home, you need your drain cleaned up prior to it results in more damage and even more expensive repairs.</p>
