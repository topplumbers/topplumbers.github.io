The tough water minerals are caught in a trace and the softener amount of salt drains with the softened water.</p>
<p>Clearly the resin is not a limitless exchange website. When all the salt exchange websites are changed with solidity minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize as soon as backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will instantly change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch.
