<p>The brine tank aids the water softening system in regeneration. It is a much shorter tank that sits nearby to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds a highly concentrated service of salt (or often potassium) to bring back the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is manually contributed to the brine tank in the type of blocks or pellets. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capacity of the resin is diminishing, the heavy brine option is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.

By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in case you need to provide some type of maintenance to it or perhaps while you're working on installing it.
