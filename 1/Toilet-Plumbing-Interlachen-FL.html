Current Review: Carlos and Lopez were fantastic. My 90 years of age Father's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos arrived at 8am the next day to repair. Because of the age of the home and location of the pipe, it was a hard job. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to ensure the system was working prior to they left. I am genuinely grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>
<p>The secret to avoiding a clogged waste disposal unit is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at a sensible amount, there ought to be no concern in getting the majority of the waste through. There are a couple of food products you must probably not put into the garbage disposal though. Those items are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another pointer to stop blocking is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for several seconds after you are ended up cleaning to ensure the drain is clear.</p>

If it is one of the discussed concerns, a repair or replacement of the components may suffice.
