<p>In some homes, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when searching for a viable solution, especially when simple plunging doesn't seem to work. However, there are lots of disadvantages to using these harmful items - not least of which is that they usually contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a clog, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of presenting the risk of damage to your house and family.</p>
