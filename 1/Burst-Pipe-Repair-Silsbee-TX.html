<h3>Trusted Home Plumbing Services Silsbee TX</h3>
<p>The Plumbers Connection can unclog your storm drain systems with making use of a hydrojetting machine. The hydrojet has a spinning head on the head that launches an extremely high pressure stream of water. The rapidly swirling water has the ability to jet" through the most difficult of blockages consisting of mud, leaves, branches, garbage and more. The end outcome is a storm drain system that is clean and complimentary of particles and prepared for service.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned up quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, emitting from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to remove particles such as difficult water scale, grease, silt, and sand deposits.</p>

Others may not meet state and local regulations and may need to be replaced with the proper backflow preventer.</p>
<p>I believe I got duped. I called believing it could perhaps be fixed, however they said it would need to be replaced.
