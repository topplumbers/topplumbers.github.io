<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean supply of water pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
