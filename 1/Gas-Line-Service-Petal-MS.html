High energy expenses? It might be time for a brand-new hot water heater. However in order to profit of a brand-new energy-efficient home appliance, you'll need to have it set up effectively. A hot water heater that is not set up correctly can result in water damage, scalding temperatures, or perhaps a fire. That's why installation is best left to professional plumbers who know the ins and outs of your plumbing system.</p>

Tankless electric hot water heater use less power than standard water heaters because they only heat water when required.</p>
<p>So now that you know you have a backup in your main line, how do you clear it? Unfortunately, main line obstructions are not something a homeowner can fix.
