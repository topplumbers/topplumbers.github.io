<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming drinkable supply of water. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical type of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
