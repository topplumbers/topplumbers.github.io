<p>In some homes, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to approach when looking for a feasible solution, specifically when simple plunging doesn't appear to work. However, there are many disadvantages to utilizing these hazardous items - not least of which is that they generally consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a blockage, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of presenting the threat of harm to your home and family.</p>
