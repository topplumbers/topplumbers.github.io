<h3>Experts In Plumbing, Heating, Cooling & Electrical Services Seymour IN</h3>
<p>The most reliable way to attend to tough water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When difficult water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Depending on the extent of the clog, we might use a range of different techniques, the most typical being hydro-jetting. Hydro-jetting is an innovative kind of drain cleaning where we use water under high pressure to totally clear out whatever inside your drains. Lay the garbage disposal on its side and eliminate the electrical cover plate from the bottom. Loosen the green ground screw and eliminate wire ports. Disconnect garbage disposal wires from electrical supply wires. Loosen screws on the electrical clamp connector and get rid of wires from the waste disposal unit.</p>
