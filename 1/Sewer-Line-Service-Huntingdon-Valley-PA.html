<h3>Residential Plumbing Contractor Huntingdon Valley PA</h3>
<p>Another common argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves need to prevent backflow.  The apparent issue with this is that if the backflow takes place at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic by hand operated valve should stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  However the majority of the automated valves, such as the electric solenoid valves used for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
<p>Water softeners normally have a life-span of 15 years, however, water softener systems can last a lot longer if they are appropriately kept. Making sure the brine tank never lacks salt will extend the system's life.  Protecting the resin bed from high levels of iron and manganese will also protect the unit. Iron will nasty the resin and lower its ion exchange performance. Resin cleaners improve the regeneration cycle and help relieve the resin beads of hardness-causing minerals.</p>
