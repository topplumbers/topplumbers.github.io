<h3>Plumbing Services Around Staten Island NY</h3>
<p>The most effective way to resolve difficult water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When tough water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Any time the pressure on the property (downstream) side surpasses the pressure on the city side, the 2 redundant check valves close-- preventing any backflow. However, while DCV systems are considered safe for most fire defense systems, they do have a flaw: if both valves stop working or particles in the water line prevents them from closing completely, backflow can take place.</p>
