It is very difficult to judge such claims, which are practically never ever based on tests that are well enough described to allow others to assess them and to verify the results. While the absence of "clinical" proof does not in itself revoke a claim for the efficacy of a device, it should make one hesitate to accept it without some assurance of performance.</p>
<p>Toilets are tough things to know. They've been built basically the same way for centuries, so you can't actually inform how old they are.

<p>Often, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces information on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to know what the field test information implies for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
