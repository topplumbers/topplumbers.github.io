House owners can simply unscrew the aerator screen from the faucet to clean out minerals or other deposits. If the shutoff valves under the sink are not open all the method, water pressure can also be low.</p>
<p>Whether you're a house owner, business owner, or residential or commercial property supervisor, at some time you will most likely need to call a plumber. It's a good concept to do a little research into the world of plumbing before you call someone and turn them loose on your plumbing system. A good plumber can save your bacon.
