<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are measured from the within bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water supply shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer lowers water service pressure to the structure; extra, more substantial expenses can occur if the drop in water pressure becomes a concern for homeowners. If setting up a pump or larger size water service and backflow prevention device would combat the pressure loss, a PE or RA can help figure out.</p>
