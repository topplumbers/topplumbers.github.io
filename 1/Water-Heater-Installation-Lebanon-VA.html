<p>There's a great opportunity you have galvanized pipes if you have an older home. And if your house was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing completion of their life-span. As galvanized pipes age, they start to wear away. This deterioration can lead to an accumulation of lead, which can have many unfavorable effects on your health. Corroded pipes also result in poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>Low pH also increases the corrosiveness of water. pH is the measure of hydrogen ion activity in a service and is utilized to reveal the intensity of the level of acidity of a service. Solutions with a low pH (< 7) are acids; solutions with a high pH (> 7) are bases. Acids are compounds that release hydrogen ions, which oxidize the metals in pipes, accelerating deterioration Carbon dioxide will potentially contribute to the formation of carbonic acid, thus making the water more destructive. The presence of high levels of carbon dioxide tends to associate with specific geologic conditions.</p>
