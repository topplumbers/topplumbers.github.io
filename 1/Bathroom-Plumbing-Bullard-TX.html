<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
