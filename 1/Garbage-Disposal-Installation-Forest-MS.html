<p>The most reliable method to attend to hard water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When tough water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>This is very important! When you have cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet provides to push the waste out of your drain system. Current policies limit the amount of water a toilet can utilize per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave particles piling up in cast iron drain lines.
