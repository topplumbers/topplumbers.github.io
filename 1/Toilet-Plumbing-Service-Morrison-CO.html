<p>Video cameras are one of the most valuable tools in the plumbing company. When shopping for a brand-new flapper, your best alternative is to attempt and find the very same flapper that originally included your existing flush valve.

If you don't understand your model number, nevertheless, we do use an extensive choice of "will fit" flappers to help you out.

<p>The person who does the testing must be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not needed to get this accreditation. I've checked with a couple of plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, however I would anticipate the cost to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
