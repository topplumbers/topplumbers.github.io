<h3>Top Rated Atlanta Plumber Freehold NJ</h3>
<p>The most efficient way to deal with tough water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When tough water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>The most common method for producing soft water is through ion exchange, a procedure in which the calcium and magnesium in the water are exchanged for another component, typically sodium. Sodium won't cause lime scale or soap scum buildup like other minerals do, and water softening includes only an extremely small amount of salt to your water. According to the Mayo Clinic, an 8-ounce glass of soft water would have less than 12.5 milligrams of salt, which is thought about very low sodium" by the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
