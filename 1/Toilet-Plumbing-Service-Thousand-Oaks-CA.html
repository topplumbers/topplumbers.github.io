<p>In water distribution systems, water is typically maintained at a substantial pressure to enable water to flow from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure may fail or be lowered when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high demand on the water system (for instance, when numerous fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe may enable contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
