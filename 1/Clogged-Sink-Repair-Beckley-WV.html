<p>All piping under sinks and faucets are checked for leakages or damage. How to inform if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and consist of the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we suggest having them replaced right away. Before you can request an inspection, you should first get the needed permit( s) for the work you intend to do.
