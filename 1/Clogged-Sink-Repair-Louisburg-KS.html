Illness can result from ingesting water that has actually been polluted due to backflow.</p>
<p>The next requirements to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is important that the repair technician understands the right installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly.

A lot of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is very important that the assembly only be installed if it is approved for that orientation.
