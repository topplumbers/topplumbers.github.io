Invasive tree roots can cause significant plumbing problems, particularly in older neighborhoods with clay sewer lines.</p>

The issue could spread out tremendously if that polluted water were to backflow into the neighborhood drinking supply. A backflow preventer not just safeguards drinking water in private residences, it likewise prevents wastewater in private houses from flowing back out and infecting the public supply of water.</p>
