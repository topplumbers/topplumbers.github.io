A toilet's tank is composed of multiple little moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be replaced or fixed due to their frequent usage. When these parts wear, they result in tiny leakages that are tough to see with the naked eye. This is why it is important to call a plumber as soon as you believe you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not only does a leaking toilet waste water, it can also result in flooding and water damage.</p>
