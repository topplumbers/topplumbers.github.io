<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Functions automated shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or natural gas is extremely low. Rainwater which has not infiltrated the earth is a remarkably pure kind of water. When water evaporates it leaves behind dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when vaporized water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>Backflow is the unwanted reversal of circulation of water which may carry dirty water or other, hazardous substances into the public water system and private plumbing. Backflow can occur in a number of situations that may draw water from places such as garden water fountains, swimming pools, or lawn sprinkler systems into City supply of water lines. Backflow can also bring water into your plumbing if it is linked to any outdoors water source. One example would be a garden hose connected to an external faucet with the end left in a mud puddle in a garden area.</p>
<p>You probably know something about your drains: they take water from your showers, sinks, and bath tubs to a local water treatment facility. When drains are working appropriately that's actually all you need to learn about them, however when something goes wrong, you need to have a deeper understanding of what type of problems can occur in pipes and how to fix them without doing more damage. That's where a professional plumber is available in-- they have the proficiency to diagnose a problem and the tools and understanding to fix it.</p>
<p>Grey = End-User Pressure - water pushes past the # 2 check valve into the system of the end user. The # 2 Check prevents backflow caused by pressure boosts in the down stream plumbing. While the majority of plumbers anticipate payment on the day of service, or in a timely manner once they have actually sent out a billing, many plumbing contractors require that you pay a deposit upfront. A deposit of no more than half of the job estimate is generally collected in advance and deducted from the overall task cost when it is completed.</p>
