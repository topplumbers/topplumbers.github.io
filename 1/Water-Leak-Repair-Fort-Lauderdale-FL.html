Given that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promo have been claimed, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only alter the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has revealed a reduction of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>

<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was rather affordable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
