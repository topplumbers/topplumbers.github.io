<p>Sewer linings can assist to repair cracked pipes without needing to totally replace your sewer lines or destroy the area around them. Day to day usage must not cause a water softener to leak. Leakages can also happen if you run into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from happening, install the unit in a steady and safe location. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the nation, protect the softener so that if the foundation starts moving, the softener doesn't tip over and remove the plumbing. You should wait till after the cycle is completed and then examined the system for cracks or broken fittings if your water softener is leaking throughout regeneration. You need to likewise check to make certain your drain line is never blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener throughout regeneration and flood your basement or garage.</p>

I've talked to a couple of plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, however I would expect the rate to be substantially less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
