<p>Supply of water by the public utility contains some quantities of damaging chemicals like arsenic and lead. Water filtration systems remove these impurities to make drinking water clean, clear and tastier. As such, water filtration systems are important requirements, not optional costs. A home plumbing inspection will either be visual, done with a camera, or a mix of both.</p>
<p>We have an inspection program to determine water sources and situations that require backflow prevention devices. For home, it is very important for owners to alert the District if any modifications are made, such as digging a brand-new well. For commercial home, the District evaluates the use of each new tenant. If the existing backflow is not up to District code, the correction needs to be made prior to water service is permitted. Cost for the device is covered by either the residential or commercial property or the renter owner.</p>

While most plumbers anticipate payment on the day of service, or in a timely manner once they have sent out an invoice, lots of plumbing contractors need that you pay a deposit upfront. A deposit of no more than half of the task estimate is normally collected beforehand and deducted from the total task cost when it is finished.</p>
