<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>

<p>Against this, there is some anecdotal evidence that particular magnetic and electro-magnetic devices can be reliable in avoiding scale formation in hard water systems. It is very difficult to evaluate such claims, which are practically never ever based upon tests that are well enough described to permit others to examine them and to confirm the results. While the absence of "scientific" evidence does not in itself revoke a claim for the effectiveness of a device, it should make one think twice to accept it without some guarantee of performance.</p>
<p>To make it simple, property owners with testable backflow devices are supposed to have them tested by a certified tester yearly.
