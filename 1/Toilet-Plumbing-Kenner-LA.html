Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be thoroughly created and installed to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
