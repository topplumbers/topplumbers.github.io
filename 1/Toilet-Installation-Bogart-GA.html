<p>The Plumbing and Gas Piping Program IVR system is now accepting inspection requests. CenterPoint Energy's House Service Plus provides you an optional Pipe Security Prepare for just $3.95 a month. It covers interior, easily available, gas pipes running from the gas meter to your natural gas appliances.

<p>The salt water tank aids the water softening system in regeneration. It is a shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The salt water tank holds an extremely focused solution of salt (or sometimes potassium) to bring back the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is manually contributed to the brine tank in the type of blocks or pellets. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capability of the resin is decreasing, the heavy salt water option is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. The water passing through the unit will no longer be softened if the brine tank runs out of salt.</p>
<p>Tank to Tank installation: On average, replacing a gas or electrical water tank with a similar design takes 2 to 3 hours. It takes in between 45 to 60 minutes to drain, detach and eliminate your old hot water heater. Placing the brand-new system takes roughly 30 minutes, and it takes another 45 to 60 minutes to secure the new connection points and verify that all functions depend on code.</p>
