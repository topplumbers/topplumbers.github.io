<h3>Blocked Drains in Willimantic CT 06226 - Various Tools Used</h3>
<p>Backflow means the unfavorable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be carefully developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>

Not only will they use water from any readily available source to accomplish their objective, however fire department vehicles often carry non-potable water treated with antifreeze, corrosion inhibitors, or extinguishing representatives.</p>
