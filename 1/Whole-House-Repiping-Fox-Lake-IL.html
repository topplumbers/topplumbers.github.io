<p>Water temperature level concerns can be repaired by adjusting the temperature on the water heater. Low water pressure from a sink faucet might be brought on by a blocked aerator screen. Homeowners can simply loosen the aerator screen from the faucet to clean out minerals or other deposits. If the shutoff valves under the sink are not open all the way, water pressure can also be low.</p>
<p>In reality, that's how tough water" got its name, from the hardened mineral deposits this sort of water leaves.
