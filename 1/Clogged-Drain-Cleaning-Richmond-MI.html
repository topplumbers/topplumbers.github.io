As helpful as this gas is, the functions that make this gas hazardous is its odorless and colorless nature, which makes it a quiet killer. However, to thwart off that threat, mercaptans are added into gas, which gives it a rotten egg smell and makes it detectable when leaking. Ensure to just rely on an utmost professional with your gas line repair in Richmond.</p>
