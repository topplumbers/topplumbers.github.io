<p>By itself, natural gas is colorless and odorless. The majority of energy companies include a sulfur compound to gas, which is where the rotten egg smell comes from. That way, you can easily inform if you have a gas leak. In most cases, when a garbage disposal system is no longer working, the motor has stopped working, and the total cost of the repair will likely exceed the cost of installing a brand-new unit.</p>

<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer kit will be connected to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws originally intended for the disposer discharge elbow. If your set only consists of a waste arm, it is possible - though not suggested - to link this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint. The successive 90 Â° turns in such a setup can result in inappropriate drainage. Depending upon the length of the waste arm, you might be able to cut off its elbow and use the remainder as a straight discharge tube.</p>
