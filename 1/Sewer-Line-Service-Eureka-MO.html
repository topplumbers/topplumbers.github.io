<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Fed Up With False Assures? Water flows in the tank where small resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads act as a sponge, adsorbing the solidity minerals from your water. This procedure is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have actually maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a process called regeneration). During this process, the resin beads are cleaned with the highly focused saltwater service (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The brine requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and replaced with sodium or potassium ions.</p>

This can force the safe and clean water to reverse its direction of circulation through the cross-connection between the 2 systems. Possible pollutants can then enter the safe and clean water supply. The best way to lower accumulation is have a professional flush it at least as soon as a year. In some areas of Virginia, where the water is especially tough with high mineral content, you may need to flush the water heater more often.</p>
