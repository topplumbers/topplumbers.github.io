This is most likely due to the reality that there are anywhere from 300 to 350 million toilets in the U.S. alone. Due to the large number of toilets, we have fixed lots of toilets in houses throughout the Tampa area so we are very familiar with the products utilized and how they are set up here locally. We also have actually done lots of toilet replacements too; this is generally called for when either a resident decides to replace their toilet with possibly a more effective one or when a toilet is just beyond repair.</p>
