<p>If you observe low water pressure or tarnished water, it typically symbolizes rust and mineral buildup. As rust and minerals build up over time, they constrict the circulation of the water which is why you might notice lower water pressure.

Having plumbing pipes that have rust or corrosion can become a health danger in your water.</p>
