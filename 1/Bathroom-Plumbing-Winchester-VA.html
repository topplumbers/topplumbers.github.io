<p>The secret to preventing a clogged garbage disposal is small amounts. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at an affordable amount, there need to be no issue in getting most of the waste through. There are a few food products you should probably not put into the garbage disposal though. Those products are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another tip to stop blocking is to look out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for several seconds after you are ended up cleaning to ensure the drain is clear.</p>
