Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is developed because of the procedure. When galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals.

The installers start by placing a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is utilized to drag the head through the pipe.

The pipe is a plastic material that will be invulnerable to root invasion for up to 100 years.</p>
