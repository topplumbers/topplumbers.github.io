<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the houses in our area were developed prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became basic. Older houses were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that can be found in contact with water and oxygen will wear away. This deterioration, or rust, causes the iron to inflate and end up being flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and creates a waterproof membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>Do not put everything down your garbage disposal. It's important to enjoy what you put down your waste disposal unit. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when combined with water, and possibly cause a clog. Fruit and vegetable peels can likewise trigger blockages and jams - consider composting or placing these products in the garbage. Additionally, grease and oil can cake and gather in your drain as well. After completing cooking, consider pouring remaining grease or oil into a container or bowl to set aside. You can then utilize and reheat for other cooking or easily place in the garbage after it's hardened.</p>
