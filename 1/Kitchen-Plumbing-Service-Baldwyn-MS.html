<p>When water is hard, it can clog pipes and soap will liquify in it less quickly. Water softening can avoid these negative impacts. Gas is a colorless, odorless fuel. As a safety precaution, we include a chemical odorant called mercaptan that gives natural gas a smell typically associated with rotten eggs. This distinct fragrance permits you to smell a possible leak if it occurs. If you think a leak, always leave.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite affordable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very delighted with their service.</p>
