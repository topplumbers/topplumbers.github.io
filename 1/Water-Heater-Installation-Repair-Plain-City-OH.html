<p>Chelation: Another approach is to introduce a chemical compound that acts as a chelating representative.

<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you very first try using non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Simply pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. You can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that doesn't work. Many of these cleaners contain concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very harmful if it is available in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If utilizing one of these items, please make sure to take the appropriate safety measures.</p>
