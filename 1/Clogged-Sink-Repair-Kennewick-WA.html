Inspect to see if there is a buildup of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can settle on the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will imply that less water will be heated up and offered for use.

Getting a new one is more affordable if the cost to repair your water tank is 50% or more than the cost of a brand-new one.</p>
