<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic deterioration Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever two various kinds of metal are conductively linked to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is produced since of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
