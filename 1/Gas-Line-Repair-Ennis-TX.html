<p>You reside in an older home. If your house is 50 years old or older and you've never changed its pipes, there's a likelihood that you'll need to have it done soon. Galvanized pipes were most often installed in homes of this age, and these kinds of pipes are known to wear away and burst when they get old. You may need to add a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you do not already have one if so. This generally includes anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the general cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
