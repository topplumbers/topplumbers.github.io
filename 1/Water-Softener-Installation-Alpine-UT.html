<p>The U-shaped pipe beneath kitchen and bathroom sinks is something that people expect to see however seldom stop to think about. Energy Performance. Choosing a tank with a minimum of 1.5 inches of foam insulation and an Energy Star ranking is advisable. The energy efficiency of a storage hot water heater is shown by its Energy Factor (EF).
