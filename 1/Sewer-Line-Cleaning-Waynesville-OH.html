<p>Downsides to be aware of is that hybrid water heaters need to be installed in an area that stays between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need as much as 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, because the heatpump is on top of the hot water heater. Also, hybrids require up to 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to capture enough heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to release the condensate.</p>
