A toilet's tank is composed of several little moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be changed or fixed due to their frequent use. When these parts break, they lead to small leaks that are tough to see with the naked eye. This is why it is essential to call a plumber as quickly as you think you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not only does a leaking toilet drainage, it can also result in flooding and water damage.</p>
