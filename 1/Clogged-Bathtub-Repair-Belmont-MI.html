Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they should be carefully developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
