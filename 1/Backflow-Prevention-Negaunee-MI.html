Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is a choice to consider if you reside in an older house - such as one built pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing.

<p>The most effective way to resolve hard water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When tough water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Use of tankless systems in second homes removes risks of water damage.
