<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, releasing from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to get rid of particles such as difficult water scale, sand, silt, and grease deposits.</p>
