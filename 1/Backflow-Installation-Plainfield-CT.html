<p>To determine if your home is a poly house," start with the outside. Underground water mains are typically blue in color (they can also be black or gray). The pipe is usually 1/2 to 1-inch in diameter. Frequently, it goes into the house near the hot water heater. Your main shut down is connected to the end of the water main. Ensure you check both ends of the pipe. We have actually found cases where the copper pipe goes into the home and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>

Well, after 60 years or more, the friction of the water going through the pipe has simply completely worn away all of the zinc finish.
