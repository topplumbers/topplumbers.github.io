<p>Backflow means the undesirable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they must be carefully developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
