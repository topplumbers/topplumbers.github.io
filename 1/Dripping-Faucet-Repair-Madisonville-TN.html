<p>In this situation, dirty water from the hillside swimming pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank. You also need to buy a backflow valve if you see your water has an uncommon circulation, color, smell or taste. A plumbing professional can figure out whether the problem with your faucet is a fast fix or the outcome of other problems in your house's plumbing system. More complicated problems with water temperature or pressure might need changing the hot water heater, which normally costs $350-$ 3,500, depending upon capability and type.</p>
<p>City of Bellingham examines backflow assemblies upon installation and carries out regular re-inspections on all existing assemblies.
