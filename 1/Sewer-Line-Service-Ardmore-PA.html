<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some components might have really tight tolerances that have to be preserved. An essential thing to determine on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the part. The guide is a really important part of the design of each component. If the component is not fixed properly, the guide could limit the motion (rather than direct or steady) of the part, which could cause the part to not work to its abilities. Often times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the component triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
