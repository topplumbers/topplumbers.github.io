<p>Sometimes, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces information on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to understand what the field test data implies for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester analyzes the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
