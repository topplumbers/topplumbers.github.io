Applications vary from softening in remote places to attending to issues of reagent addition. Motor sizes for garbage disposal are given in horsepower, or HP. These correspond straight to how much waste the unit can manage, and suggested sizes are normally based upon the number of users are in a household. If your existing disposal clogs typically, is noisy, leaks or does not run correctly, it might be time for a replacement.
