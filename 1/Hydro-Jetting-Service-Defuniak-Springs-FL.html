In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to only abandon the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason why we will advise a complete repipe in specific areas, based on our experience.</p>

<p>Check the house's hot water heater You will be looking to see if it is huge enough to accommodate your needs (a family of 4 should have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it lies, and the water heater's age. Inspect to see if there is an accumulation of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can settle on the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will imply that less water will be heated and available for usage. Likewise, rust of the tank's elements can cause the tank to have a short life. Request that a brand-new one be installed if the water heater is old or you see apparent indications of corrosion.</p>
<p>You don't always need a new hot water heater. Oftentimes a basic repair can prolong the life of your hot water heater for many years to come. Appropriate flushing and yearly hot water heater maintenance will also help your sytem lead a long, efficient life. We provide expert basic and tankless hot water heater service and repair for locals in Lasalle, Peru, Ottawa, Princeton and the surrounding area.</p>
