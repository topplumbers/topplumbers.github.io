<p>Manual leak detection for drainage applications is the most basic of the 3 available methods. Tankless units last 5-10 years longer than tanked systems and need less repairs over time.

During regeneration, salted water from the salt water tank flows up the fill tube and into the softener tank. A rinse cycle commences and the salted water washes the mineral deposits off the resin beads. The regenerated water and the mineral deposits are flushed out the discharge hose. The system then reverts back to softening the incoming water.</p>
