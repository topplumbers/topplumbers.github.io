<h3>Best Plumbing Service Company In Saint Marys OH</h3>
<p>These guys were incredible! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue off and on for many years now. It was set up 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company because they had terrific evaluations and a fair cost, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a fantastic task cleaning up after it too.</p>
