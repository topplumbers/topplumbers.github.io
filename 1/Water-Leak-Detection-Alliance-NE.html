<p>Agilent's series of leak detection solutions ensure the safety, security and consistent efficiency of research, vacuum, and industrial process systems. Inspecting the water meter is a great next step in your plumbing inspection. If the water meter is turning, close all faucets and examine. If it is, there is a leak someplace and this could be severe issue. Move on to the valves. Start with the main shut down valve operation. When shut down, no faucet in your house should have water. This opts for every other shut off valve and their matching faucets. You are off to an excellent start if whatever is working effectively.</p>
