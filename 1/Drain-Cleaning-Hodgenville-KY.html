<p>Backflow indicates the undesirable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable water supply; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a drinkable water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they should be carefully developed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
<p>This is an elbow-shaped device bent at a 90 degree angle. There is a valve on the inside of it that avoids water backflow. The system is based upon pressure and needs to be installed a minimum of 6 inches of where the downstream will be. It can be put on PVC pipes, but is not testable.
