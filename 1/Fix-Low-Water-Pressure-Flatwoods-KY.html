<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we reveal are determined from the within bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water system shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer minimizes water service pressure to the structure; extra, more significant expenses can occur if the drop in water pressure becomes an issue for locals. If setting up a pump or larger size water service and backflow prevention device would combat the pressure loss, a PE or RA can help figure out.</p>
