<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the past. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was rather affordable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very happy with their service.</p>

<p>Often, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces information on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test information indicates for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester translates the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
