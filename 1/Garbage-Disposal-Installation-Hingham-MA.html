<p>Food scraps compose as much as 20% of all household waste. If it can quickly and rapidly be disposed of through the sink, this large quantity of trash does not need to go in the garbage can.

By installing a garbage disposal you are helping the environment by saving the amount of garbage that gets sent to landfills and other discarding locations. With a waste disposal unit the trash is managed through currently existing water facilities.</p>
