Sediment Build-Up: If you see strange popping, banging, or clanging noises originating from your system, this might be an indicator that sediment has built up in your tank, and is triggering a reaction with the heating component. Lacking hot water quickly is another indication of sediment accumulation, since the sediment is using up more space in the tank, so your water therefore takes longer to heat. To fix this issue, you will likely need to flush out the tank.</p>
<p>You might be lured to bond or spot a leak shut or replace just a single area of pipe to conserve cash. While this might work in the short term, keep in mind that the weakened pipe is made from the exact same product as other pipes in your home, meaning that difficulty might be brewing elsewhere in your plumbing system. Repiping now will give you assurance and prevent larger leakages down the roadway.</p>
