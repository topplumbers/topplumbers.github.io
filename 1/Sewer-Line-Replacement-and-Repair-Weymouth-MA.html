<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to get rid of dissolved tough water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, manganese and iron. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the hard water flows through the resin, the salt is swapped for the hard water minerals. The difficult water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace quantity of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>
