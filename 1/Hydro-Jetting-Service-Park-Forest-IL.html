<p>Sewer linings can help to repair split pipes without having to completely replace your sewer lines or damage the area around them. Day to day usage must not trigger a water softener to leak. Leakages can likewise take place if you run into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from occurring, install the system in a safe and stable  area. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the country, protect the softener so that if the foundation begins moving, the softener doesn't tip over and rip out the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking during regrowth, you should wait until after the cycle is completed and after that examined the system for fractures or broken fittings.
