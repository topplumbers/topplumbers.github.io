<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a worn flapper is typically the culprit. But not always. First, look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing securely if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with too little slack can cause problem too. Picture 3 demonstrates how to set the slack just right.</p>
<p>Idea: Plug the sink with a stopper, fill with about an inch of water and check the flange and drain for leaks. Backflow - Do you observe water coming back in your sink or shower?
