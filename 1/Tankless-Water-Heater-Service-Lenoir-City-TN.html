<p>Gas leaks are typically found at the gas valve, flare fitting, or at the gas union-a piece that enables connections and disconnections of gas devices.

If it bubbles, you likely have a gas leak and should immediately call a gas plumber to perform an emergency gas line repair.</p>
<p>Colored water-- If your warm water seems rusty, this might be a sign that your hot water heater is rusting on the inside and may begin leaking quickly.

<p>Improvement plumbers normally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. However a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest far more. With this technique, you know the turnkey price entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
