That's where the salt water tank can be found in. An on-board computer system calculates the quantity of water that flows through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regrowth instantly begins. For a three-bedroom house and household of 4, regeneration normally occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>
