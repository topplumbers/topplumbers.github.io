<p>On and off does any structural damage take place as the result of slab leak. A slab leak is typically discovered before it triggers any substantial damage. The water leak is typically the size of a pinhole. This small hole enables water to continually leak out extremely gradually. In time it can lead to a considerable build of water. Dripped water generally remains under your home and saturates into the ground soil. This can possibly cause a cavity if your home's foundation was not appropriately compacted. This is an unusual occasion and in general, there is little issue over structural damage as the result of a slab leak.</p>
