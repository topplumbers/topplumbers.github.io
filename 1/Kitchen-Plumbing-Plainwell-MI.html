<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a great guy. He informed me precisely what to expect (cost, time, procedure) up front and provided as assured. I will certainly use Clog Dawg once again. Setting up a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical hourly rate of $25 to $70. These costs remain in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. The overall you pay might be higher if your plumber has a minimum callout charge that is greater than the labor cost for the work.</p>
<p>Frequently brought on by sluggish seepage from the tank into the bowl. Put a few drops of food coloring in the tank. Wait an hour, then see and examine if you see coloring in the bowl. This suggests a leaky flapper valve. Replacement is usually the fix. Additionally, in some cases a defective fill valve may actuate intermittently, as well. Water won't drain or is draining gradually through the disposal.</p>
<p>Converting your home to natural gas, or if the present line is at capability, you'll need to install a new gas line from the street to your home. This remains in addition to any interior gas lines or extensions that need to be installed. You'll have the disposer system, the sink-mounting assembly, an L-shaped tailpipe with mounting hardware, the sink stopper, and-- with some brand names-- a special hex wrenchette" that is used both for mounting the system and for inserting into a hex hole in the disposer's underside when repair is required to break complimentary blockages.</p>
