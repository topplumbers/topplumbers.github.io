<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable water supply pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
