<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to approach when looking for a practical solution, specifically when simple plunging doesn't appear to work. However, there are many downsides to using these dangerous products - not least of which is that they usually include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids.
