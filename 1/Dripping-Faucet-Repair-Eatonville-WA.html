<h3>Plumbing Camera Inspections in Eatonville Washington</h2>
<p>Your old discharge tube most likely will not be the right length for your brand-new disposal. If it's too long, simply connect it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if necessary, to place the tube back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too short, you may have to make a time-wasting trip to the shop. To avoid this, make certain the brand-new garbage disposal installation kit includes a tube, or purchase one separately at the same time for about $3.</p>
<p>A video camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it prevents the need to dig up your yard. Throughout a video camera inspection, a sewer and drain technician runs a video cable television down sewer branch lines that lead from bath tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Utilizing the images captured by the camera, we can identify any sewer and drain line problems, such as blockages, tree root invasion, misaligned joints, fractures, and other damage.</p>
