<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in San Rafael CA 94901?</h3>
<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a couple of things you can do to keep your drains clear. Prevent putting grease or oil down the drains. Use a service of baking soda and vinegar periodically to keep your drains and waste disposal unit clean. You can utilize a natural drain cleaner monthly to keep your drains clear. We advise organic items, such as Bio-Clean, since they work better than items containing extreme chemicals and will not trigger damage to your drains or components.</p>
<p>The pipe-bursting approach is used on pipes that are significantly damaged, for replacing an entire pipe system, or for repairing larger areas of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to start repair, which includes 2 4 foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers start by positioning a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its method through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and attracting a brand-new smooth pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic material that will be resistant to root intrusion for as much as 100 years.</p>
<p>When to repair: Toilet blockages are not uncommon, however if your toilet is blocking more than 3 times a month, there's a larger issue to examine. You may need to switch toilet paper or employ a plumber to clear a blockage from the drain if your toilet is relatively new. The National Contractor License Service maintains a list of each state's professional licensing company where you can search for your state's licensing information. Check the list of state licensing firms to learn whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List also keeps a licensing tool to examine state licensing requirements.</p>
<p>Clear the trap: If the above techniques do not work, the next action would be to get rid of the P-trap under the sink. Place a container below the area to catch water then loosen the 2 threaded caps that hold the curved area of the pipe in place. Nowadays, the majority of kitchen drains are made from white PVC pipe with connections that can be unscrewed by hand.</p>
