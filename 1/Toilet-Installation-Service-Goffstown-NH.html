<h3>Leaking Toilet in Goffstown New Hampshire</h2>
<p>Foul Sewer Smell: Among the very first most obvious signs of a sewer concern is a smell of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the yard (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be a basic issue such as a broken water seal, or it can show a bigger problem such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can avoid serious damage to your home.

<p>Your home's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and squander down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not really the circulation of water pushing them down your pipes. Rather, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. When something obstructs the pipes, anything you pour down there will not go through.</p>
