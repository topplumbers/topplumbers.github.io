<p>Your garbage disposal guarantees that your sink and plumbing fixtures do not get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's perception, waste disposal unit do not include blades. Rather, a garbage disposal features two fixed bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk.

This high-speed action successfully crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without obstructing.</p>
