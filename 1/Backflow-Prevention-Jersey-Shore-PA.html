Bringing water into your structure is our service. We work with contractors, designers, and property owners to develop and create spaces that are functional and lovely.</p>
<p>Home water softeners, likewise called ion exchange systems, are devices that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. As soon as the resin beads become loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride option becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
<p>So now that you understand you have a backup in your main line, how do you clear it? Unfortunately, main line obstructions are not something a homeowner can fix. This kind of clog needs a professional plumber or drain professional to use a drain cleaning machine to locate the clog and get it cleared. TLC can use a camera to see down into the drain line and locate the clog or break in the line. All TLC's Drain Cleaning Professionals are geared up with this type of camera to repair the drain and identify issue. If you have a long sewer line from your home to the sewer system or septic system, this type of camera is particularly helpful in finding an issue.</p>
