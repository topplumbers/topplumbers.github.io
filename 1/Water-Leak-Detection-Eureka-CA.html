<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic deterioration Direct contact in between different metals will start the development of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever two various kinds of metal are conductively linked to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is created because of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not entirely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
