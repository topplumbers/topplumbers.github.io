If installing a pump or larger size water service and backflow prevention device would counteract the pressure loss, a PE or RA can assist figure out.</p>
<p>Underneath the sink, stack the fiber gasket, backup flange, and mounting ring, and slide onto the underside of the flange. Install the snap ring by pulling it open and snapping into place.
