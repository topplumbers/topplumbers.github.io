<h3>Septic Tank Repair in Bettendorf Iowa</h2>
<p>Water softening utilizes a process called "ion exchange" to remove dissolved difficult water minerals such as calcium, manganese, iron and magnesium. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the hard water flows through the resin, the salt is switched for the hard water minerals. The hard water minerals are trapped in a trace and the softener amount of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
