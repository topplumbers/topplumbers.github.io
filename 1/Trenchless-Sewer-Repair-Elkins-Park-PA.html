<p>It's difficult to determine if you have cracked or broken drains till a video inspection is carried out. Split or broken drains are normally preceded by repeating blockages, consistent foul drain odors or the presence of sewer flies. The initial step is attempt to clear the blocked drain and then right away inspect the drain. In some cases a smoke test can be performed to expose breaks or cracks. ZOOM DRAIN carries out a complimentary peek video inspection with our PowerSnake and ZOOM Jetting service.</p>
