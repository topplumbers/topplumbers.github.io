When we see it in multiple drains, we wonder what's happening, but again, we just think that as long as the water still drains, we're OK. You could very well be ignoring a major issue in the drainage part of your bathroom's plumbing.">

<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason we will advise a complete repipe in specific neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
