<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach optimal capacity and can't bring in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be regenerated, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank can be found in. An on-board computer system determines the amount of water that streams through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration automatically starts. For a three-bedroom house and household of four, regeneration usually happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates information on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to know what the field test information suggests for that particular assembly.  When a skilled tester interprets the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
