<p>A cross-connection is any short-lived or irreversible connection in between a public water supply or customer's safe and clean (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system consisting of nonpotable water or other compounds. An example is the piping between a public water system or consumer's drinkable water supply and an auxiliary water system, cooling system or irrigation system.</p>
<p>Often, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates information on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test information means for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester analyzes the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
