<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason why we will recommend a complete repipe in particular communities, based upon our experience.</p>

<p>Loose flanges are usually the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends on the level of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this kind of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
