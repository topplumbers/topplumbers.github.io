<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>

When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets also) it's not actually the flow of water pressing them down your pipes.

Anything you put down there won't go through when something obstructs the pipes.</p>
