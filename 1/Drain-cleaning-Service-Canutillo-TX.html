<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code protects the public water supply and private on-site supply of water and distribution systems by restricting cross-connections between drinkable (appropriate for drinking) and non-potable water systems, and by requiring installation of secondary and primary backflow prevention methods.

<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming drinkable water supply, backpressure backflow in a building results. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
