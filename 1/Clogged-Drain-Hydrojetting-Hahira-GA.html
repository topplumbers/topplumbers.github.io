Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
