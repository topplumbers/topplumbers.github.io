<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high threat" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, but likewise has a 3rd check valve that is in fact a vent open to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk situations is due to the fact that if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains.
