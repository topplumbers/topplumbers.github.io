<p>Foul Sewer Smell: One of the first most apparent indications of a sewer problem is an odor of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the backyard (in the area where your sewer line would be).

<p>Organic particles, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's drain, snake or cable auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation.

If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
