<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to just abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason we will advise a full repipe in particular neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
