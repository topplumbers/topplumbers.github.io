<p>Plumbing is a crucial part of your home or service, and its ability to function is necessary. If you experience frequent problems with your plumbing, like drains clogging, this might be a sign of a larger problem, like a tree root intrusion or a big clog. If the drains clog periodically but you can usually flush them out, this might be a smaller sized clog like a buildup of grease from the kitchen, or hair and soap residue from the bathroom. Small blockages can develop into huge ones fairly quickly.</p>
