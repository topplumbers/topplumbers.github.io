<p>No, you should NOT put caustic chemical drain cleaners down your drains if you're major about safeguarding your drain and plumbing system.

<p>A drain professional will need to access the drain line from the roof vents or take out a toilet. This is usually more labor-intensive and might require additional expenses. This is also not as reliable due to the fact that the drain machine loses torque the even more you are away from the obstruction. If you want to put brand-new pipes in your home or you're building a home, there are 3 kinds of new plumbing pipe available that are building-code approved for homes-- copper, PEX, and CPVC (chlorinated polyvinyl chloride). PEX and CPVC are both plastics and are outstanding alternatives to the costly copper piping.</p>
