<p>You live in an older home. If your home is 50 years old or older and you've never replaced its pipes, there's a likelihood that you'll need to have it done quickly. Galvanized pipes were most often installed in houses of this age, and these types of pipes are understood to rust and burst when they get old. You may need to include a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you don't currently have one if so. This generally includes anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the overall cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>
<p>Low warm water pressure? Our experienced plumbers can recognize and resolve your low water pressure issue. Signs of deterioration or scale buildup on fixtures may suggest past leaks and high pressure. This can lead plumbers to examine if there is a larger problem needing attention. Working with gas is extremely hazardous, and it is very important to switch off the line to allow for a safe repair procedure.</p>
