This goes for every other shut off valve and their corresponding faucets. You are off to a great start if whatever is working effectively.</p>
<p>Do not put everything down your garbage disposal. It's important to watch what you put down your garbage disposal. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when blended with water, and potentially trigger a clog. Vegetables and fruit peels can also trigger jams and blockages - think about composting or placing these items in the garbage. Furthermore, grease and oil can cake and collect in your drain also.
