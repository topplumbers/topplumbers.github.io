<p>A total repipe of a home's water supply, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most complex and pricey plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on whole home repiping. For an outdoor gas light or appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can cause a blockage or can trigger corrosion that obstructs the line. Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a natural gas line. Sound-- Over time sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment ultimately gets difficult and eliminates from the capacity of your water heater. This solidified sediment is likely the source of the noise.</p>

<p>If the problems takes place well outside that 8 to 12 year life expectancy, a guideline of thumb is that you can regain the cost of the repair. If, say, you need a brand-new burner kit and the hot water heater is 5 years old, then it makes sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, specifically if you can do the work yourself. The closer the device is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more uncertain the economics of a repair becomes. The reason is that some other part on the home appliance will go or its tank will leak.
