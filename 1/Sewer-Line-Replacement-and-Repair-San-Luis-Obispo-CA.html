The typical cost to install a drip leg is $75 to $150, which is a plumber's minimum charge. For multiple installs, expenses vary from $33 to $89 per drip leg. Drip legs capture wetness so that it does not get in the control unit. Although little pieces of sediment may make it through a drip leg.</p>

The City's plumbing code requires a backflow preventer on all landscape irrigation systems, swimming pools, and hot tubs. Turn the disposal unit to line up the discharge tailpiece with the drain trap, and after that connect it. Relying on the existing trap setup, you may need to replace some or all of the drain piping underneath the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>
