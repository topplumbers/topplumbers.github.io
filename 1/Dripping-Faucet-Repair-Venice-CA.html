<p>When utilized in combating a fire, fire department connections can be an issue. Firemen by and big are not interested in backflow prevention concerns. They are worrying about protecting individuals's lives and to a lower level their residential or commercial property. Getting the required volume of water on a fire is their objective and they will utilize water from any source offered to achieve that goal.

<p>It is common for hot water heater to leak due to changing pressure, and the temperature and pressure relief valve becomes part of the unit for that precise reason. But while little drips ought to not be cause for concern, homeowners must keep an eye on the water heater leakages. I had a great experience with Gotelli Plumbing when we required a leak in a pipe fixed. Tom was friendly and professional. He also got the job done faster than initial estimated, so the work was more economical than I expected. I will use Gotelli Plumbing again in the future.</p>
