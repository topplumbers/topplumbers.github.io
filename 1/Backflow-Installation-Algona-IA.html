Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they need to be thoroughly developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
