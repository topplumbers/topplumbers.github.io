<p>Your old discharge tube most likely won't be the ideal length for your new disposal. If it's too long, just connect it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation.

To avoid this, ensure the new waste disposal unit installation kit consists of a tube, or purchase one separately at the same time for about $3.</p>
