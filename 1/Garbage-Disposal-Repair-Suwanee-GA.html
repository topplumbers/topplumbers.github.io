<p>Renovation plumbers normally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. However more and more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly spend far more. With this method, you understand the turnkey rate entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
<p>For instance, a plumber on an online forum sponsored by tool maker Ridgid reports charging $125 for a camera inspection done as part of clearing out a sewer line with a cable television and cutting blade (called snaking) or $225 if done separately. And video inspection rates at Allied Drain Cleaning 1 in Connecticut begin at $175, while Covenant Pipeline 2 in California charges a minimum of $275 for as much as 2 hours and $175 per hour for each additional hour.</p>
