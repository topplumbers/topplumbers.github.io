<p>The U-shaped pipe underneath bathroom and kitchen sinks is something that people anticipate to see but rarely stop to think about. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, but it doesn't grind up food, this means the flywheel is stuck. Attempt freeing the jam by inserting a hex wrench of the proper size into the hole on the bottom of the waste disposal unit. Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that a disposal is not like the numerous easy house enhancement jobs around your house. It includes blades, a mix of electric work, and plumbing which then means a mix of electrical energy and water. Mishaps involving garbage disposals are too common to put yourself at threat.

These are not simply going to cause the disposal not to work appropriately but are hazardous.</p>
