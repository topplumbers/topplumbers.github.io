Leaks can also occur if you bump into the softener and scramble it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from occurring, install the unit in a stable and safe place. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the nation, secure the softener so that if the foundation begins moving, the softener does not fall over and remove the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking during regeneration, you need to wait till after the cycle is finished and after that inspected the system for fractures or broken fittings. You should also check to make certain your drain line is never blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regeneration and flood your basement or garage.</p>
