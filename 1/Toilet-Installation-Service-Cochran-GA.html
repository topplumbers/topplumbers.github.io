<p>The City of Bellingham requires a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or potential cross-connection. The backflow preventer might be required on the water service line, within the structure, or in both areas.

Assemblies not presently listed need to have been noted at the time of the original installation.</p>

<h3>How To Install A Sand Trap Drain Cochran GA</h3>
<p>Another common argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves must prevent backflow.  The apparent issue with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic by hand operated valve must stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  However most of the automatic valves, such as the electric solenoid valves utilized for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and completely closed.</p>
<p>If the leaking hot water heater is inside of the house, it is nest to right away run the water off to the heater and schedule a visit with a plumber to prevent flooding inside of the house.
