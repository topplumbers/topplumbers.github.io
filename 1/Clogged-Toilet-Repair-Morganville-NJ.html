It is necessary that the repair technician understands the proper installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be installed in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. The majority of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, but it is necessary that the assembly just be set up if it is approved for that orientation.

Water pressure might stop working or be minimized when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high demand on the water system (for example, when several fire hydrants are opened).
