<p>A. Usually wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered problem. Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>

Design - Once you include a second floor and even third floor, pipes need to be run up to it. This is more complex than plumbing the ground floor and is more labor intensive.

<p>In the meantime, nevertheless, we recommend you first try utilizing non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Simply put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. You can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that does not work. A number of these cleaners include focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be extremely damaging if it can be found in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please ensure to take the appropriate precautions if utilizing among these products.</p>
