<h3>Plumbing Company Serving Hartland WI</h3>
<p>Contrary to what many believe, having a waste disposal unit actually protects your pipes and extends their life expectancy. Food washed down a drain accidentally or on function without a disposal can get stuck in pipe turns, triggering clogs and gradually harmful your plumbing system. Tiny food particles created by a garbage disposal wash straight down quickly.</p>
<p>Food scraps compose approximately 20% of all household waste. If it can easily and rapidly be disposed of through the sink, this big amount of garbage does not need to go in the garbage can. A garbage disposal works by shredding the waste into small pieces that can traveling through the sewage pipes without hindering water flow. By setting up a waste disposal unit you are helping the environment by conserving the amount of garbage that gets sent to garbage dumps and other discarding locations. With a waste disposal unit the trash is handled through currently existing water infrastructure.</p>

<p>Chelation: Another technique is to introduce a chemical compound that acts as a chelating representative. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating agent and stay suspended in the water instead of building up on surfaces. However, if they stay in one location for long, as they may in a water heater, the buildup could still take place.</p>

<p>Your garbage disposal guarantees that your sink and plumbing fixtures do not get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's perception, garbage disposals do not consist of blades. Instead, a garbage disposal features 2 stationary bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts force food and debris to grind against a fixed grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action successfully crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without obstructing.</p>
