Picking a tank with a minimum of 1.5 inches of foam insulation and an Energy Star ranking is a good idea. The energy effectiveness of a storage hot water heater is suggested by its Energy Element (EF). The more effective the hot water heater the higher the EF score.

Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for numerous years, but steel ultimately struggles with deterioration and does not have the toughness these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
