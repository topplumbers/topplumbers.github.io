<p>A guideline is that you can regain the cost of the repair if the problems happens well outside that 8 to 12 year life-span. If, state, you need a brand-new burner set and the water heater is 5 years old, then it makes good sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, specifically if you can do the work yourself. The closer the device is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more skeptical the economics of a repair becomes. The factor is that some other part on the appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no remedy for a leaking tank.</p>
<p>If you see absolutely nothing apparent, place the wrench into the motor spline, discovered at the bottom of the system, and twist ideal and left. If the motor spins freely, examine that the breaker hasn't tripped and then attempt the reset button.
