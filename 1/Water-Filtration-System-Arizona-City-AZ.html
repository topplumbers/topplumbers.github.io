<p>Your kitchen sink is an essential part of your house, which makes its plumbing's efficient functioning a need more than a need. When the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated throughout the repair procedure. It is necessary that the plumbing system be switched on very gradually to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air must be eliminated from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system must be checked to ensure no valves were unintentionally left open or did not close properly. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are entirely open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>
