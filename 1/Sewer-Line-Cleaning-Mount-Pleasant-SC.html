<p>Rusting and rust on the outside of the water heater, inlet pipes, or parts can indicate a potential problem with the hot water heater. If it is more than 6 or 7 years old, it can also mean the water heater is near the end of its life.

This pressure distinction throughout the # 1 check valve keeps the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>
