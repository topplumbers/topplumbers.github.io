<p>If you need a water softener is a personal preference, determining. Water softener systems work by eliminating solidity minerals and changing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are devices that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to inhibit the scale from building up by reducing the effects of the solidity itself. Due to the fact that water conditioners utilize a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are in some cases thought about a greener alternative in areas where it is prohibited to use salt. Water conditioners do not effectively get rid of hardness from the water supply, nevertheless, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
