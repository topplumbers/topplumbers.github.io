<p>The best method to handle high city water pressure according to the city of San Diego utilities website is by setting up a pressure lowering valve (PRV). A PRV will regulate water pressure as it comes into the home.

<p>Whether a water system is identified "soft" or "difficult" is dependent on the presence of 2 highly soluble minerals, calcium and magnesium. From a health standpoint, these minerals have no adverse impacts and are, in truth, essential day-to-day nutrients. It is minerals that offer water the revitalizing taste many people find desirable. However, when calcium and magnesium penetrate water, they buildup on contact surfaces, possibly plug pipes and damage water heaters, and decrease the efficiency of cleaning agents and soaps. At this point the water is said to be difficult.</p>
<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming potable water system. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common type of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
