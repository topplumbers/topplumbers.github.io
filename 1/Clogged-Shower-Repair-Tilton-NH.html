The keeping nut inside the tank is a reverse thread. So, if you're in front of the toilet, turn the nut to the left to loosen up (Image 1). Then eliminate the old handle and lever, slide the new deal with into location, and thread on the retaining nut. Tighten by turning to the right (Picture 2).</p>
