<p>Figuring out if you need a water softener is a personal choice. Water softener systems work by getting rid of solidity minerals and changing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are gadgets that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to prevent the scale from building up by neutralizing the firmness itself. Due to the reality that water conditioners utilize a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are often thought about a greener alternative in areas where it is prohibited to use salt. Water conditioners do not efficiently remove hardness from the water supply, nevertheless, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>

<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to only abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason why we will recommend a full repipe in certain communities, based upon our experience.</p>
