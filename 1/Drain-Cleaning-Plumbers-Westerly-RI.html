<p>Some manufacturers claim that the electrical devices they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Considering that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promotion have been claimed, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only change the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has actually revealed a reduction of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>
